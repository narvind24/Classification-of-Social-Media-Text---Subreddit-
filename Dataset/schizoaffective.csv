I've been stable for so long (probably because I started treatment so early) that it sometimes seems like I was making it up all along. I definitely remember my experience with psychosis before my diagnosis but it seems so distant now that I start thinking I was exaggerating a little bit. I showed all the warning signs during my senior year of high school then when I moved away from my family for school, shit really hit the fan with my mental health and I checked myself into the hospital where I was diagnosed. 

 I hear voices constantly telling me I'm lying and that I'm actually totally fine. Sometimes I believe them and I almost want to stop taking my meds just to see if symptoms return so I know for a fact that I actually have this illness.

The phone call I got to come to see my brother at the hospital was not out of the ordinary. He was born with spina bifida and as such he was in and out of the hospital a lot in his life. I was getting ready for work that night anyway as I worked 3rd shift at the time. My younger brother and I went up to the hospital together, neither aware of what we were walking into. Even as we got to the ER and were escorted back to the room, nothing seemed out of the ordinary to me. I was just hoping it was something minor most likely associated with a light seizure as they had become rather common at that point in his life. Nothing in all my life's experience could prepare me for what I was about to go through. I'm a veteran of the military and had a pretty rough life growing up, until I got married and settled down, so I don't scare easy and crying was not an option if you know what I mean. There were several doctors there and other people, so that changed my focus a bit and I became concerned. My older brother was tough as nails and kinder than almost anyone I have ever known. He had made it through more surgeries than I could count, and had defied all the odds and fought through everything life didn't hand to him. When they opened that door and I saw so much of my family gathered around a bed that had him laying in it. He still had the breathing tube in his mouth and none of the machines were hooked up to him, no tubes hooked up no iv lines or bags. The looks on everyone's faces as they saw me walk towards the entrance of that door told me everything I needed to know. I don't think I made it into the room for a few minutes. My heart stopped beating, everything seemed to slow down and I had an episode at that point i think. I was watching everything happen from afar like it was a dream, in a fog or something like that. My entire life the only constant I had ever had the only person that was always there that I knew understood me was dead. Everything just felt surreal to me for a few minutes. I don't know what, if anything that I did or said for a bit. Seeing my father and his grief of losing his son, who he still had living with him and took care of his boy everyday, wrecked me. My younger brother was equally devastated as well. We as a family gathered and said prayers for him. I said mine to him in private, most of my family is catholic and has a disdain for my ""heathen"" beliefs. I have lost quite a few very close people in my 43 years. They can never be replaced, but the grief you carry with you about them I believe that the grief is just your love for them that you cannot share physically with them. So when that grief hits you just remember that of you didn't love them so much, it wouldn't still hurt so much. If that makes sense? I miss my older brother everyday, I keep photos of him close, I share stories with my children and family about him. I cry sometimes when I think of him. Like I wrote in the beginning it may be long winded, but I am sharing this in the hope that it will help someone else. I have many psychiatric troubles I guess you can call them. Depression and schizoaffective among others. It has taken me 6 years to be able to get this out of my head. Hope it helps, me and you.",12,0

I’ve decided to go into the planning stages. To do this above board and right. The first thing would be proving my concept and studying very hard because I realized last night that industrial or commercial cleaning is done very different.",14,0

If you do please do it with supervision of your doctor. Don't stop cold turkey. 

I've been off my meds for a week now. Not by choice but because my previous psychiatrist left without putting in refills. The medications I'm on are: Effexor, Lithium, Mini press, Trazedone, Topamax and Klonopin.

This has been the worst week ever. It's like I have the flu. Nausea, dizzy and everything is too bright. Sounds are amplified. I'm hungry but I can't eat. I'm thirsty but I just vomit. I'm cold then I'm hot. If I move my eyes my brain makes this zapping noise.

Then there's the shadows, I see them everywhere. I'm paranoid to the max. The voices won't shut up. I wanna cry all the time. I never cry.

I had to call a nurses line to see how I could get refills til I see my new psychiatrist. She said there's nothing she could. I finally saw my new psychiatrist via video call. I can't remember anything he said but that he put in new refills. 

I started taking those today. I drove myself to the pharmacy which I shouldn't have because I don't remember how I got there. 

Hopefully one I start taking these again I'll be back to my usual self. Cause if this is how one week without feels like I don't want to miss any days.",22,0
29,"My newly diagnosed SO just got home from the hospital, but I think she is still having delusions and is making a lot of sudden life changes. Advice needed 😔",16,jy06uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/jy06uw/my_newly_diagnosed_so_just_got_home_from_the/,44,1605915500.0,"My SO (I guess I have to say ex now 😔) and I were together for almost 9 years. She is 24 years old, probably helpful to mention she is transitioning male to female for the last 6 months. She has struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and abused drugs when she was a young teen.

She was put on Zoloft in July for depression. During the second week of September, she went into full blown psychosis and was very delusional. She was trying to tell me about spiritual things and her spiritual awakening which escalated to her thinking she was God, searching for God, God talking to her, she thought for a bit I was the devil and sometimes I could be standing across the room and she think I was hurting her or yelling at her, her mood was all over the place, she tried hurting herself and threatened to hurt me... The types of delusions go on. 

She was in the hospital for a week, and then three days later ended up in another hospital for a month, then sent to a step down recovery center for 10 days. She ended up on 20mg Abilify, stopped Zoloft, and added in propranolol for restlessness/anxiety from the Abilify. She was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and unspecified personality disorder with borderline traits. 

Ever since coming home last week, she seems... different. In the weeks prior to this, everything seemed good. During her psychosis and coming out of it, she did have several ""crushes"" on other patients and questioned her feelings for me but she stabilized and like I said, everything seemed great. She was excited to come home and work on herself and our relationship.

She was stable when she first got home and the abilify seemed to have been working wonders when hospitalized, but the longer she was home, the more changes I noticed. She broke up with me suddenly and unexpectedly and is questioning her sexuality after being very openly bisexual/pansexual for her entire life, she was very political and took down all of her political posters, she is very spiritual and has been talking more and more about God, and says that me and her are ""on different vibrations/wavelengths"" now. I could go in more detail but it would be too long.

The biggest thing I am concerned about, besides her seemingly changing everything that defines her as a person, are these strong what I believe to be delusions of reference. She can't listen to a song, watch a movie, play games, read a book, or anything of that sort without thinking the universe or god is speaking to her or has some sort of hidden meaning. For example, if a break up song is on, she thinks it means we are supposed to be broken up. She thinks the world is on the verge of a ""spiritual awakening."" She feels everything is predetermined and all choices she makes in her life has to be decided by the universe or god. She has been reading the bible a lot (atheist prior to psychosis), and flips to random passages and thinks they are meant to govern her life. The other night, she got back with me for like 2 days because the bible told her ""she had wronged me"" and I was the one for her, only to question everything and say she needed someone to ""pull her out the depths of her mind"" and that I wasn't on the same wavelength as her and I was ""too pure,"" etc.

She also has some dry skin between her fingers that changes depending how irritated it is, and she thinks when they get more red, it's a sign she did something wrong/bad and is being punished, and if it fades then she did something right/good. She feels her psychosis is the time that she was ""marked"" by God and is being punished. She has also been very flat and off and on crying/depressed.

Long story short... She had her first psychiatrist appointment a couple days ago. She did not tell her about the delusions or explain how depressed she actually is. The psychiatrist nor her therapist will talk to me without her signing an ROI, which she will not do. She truly doesn't believe these are delusions, but they are dictating her life.

TL;DR: My SO of 9 years was just diagnosed with schizoaffective BP type, and unspecified personality disorder. She was hospitalized for over a month after new onset psychosis/mania. She just got home and suddenly broke up with me and is questioning literally every thing about herself - sexuality, interests, new religion/spirituality, no longer political... And now has delusions of reference and she believes it is just the universe talking to her, and not delusions. I can't talk to her psychiatrist/therapist without her signing an ROI. Do these seem like delusions? Is it normal for her to be changing/questioning every aspect of her life, especially her long term relationship with me (her most stable support system) so suddenly? What can I do to help her? Obviously her 20mg of Abilify is no longer working 😔",16,0

I’d say most bipolars, schizoaffectives, and even schizophrenics have a strange piece of their Illness they don’t want to give up - hell, that they even love. Obviously for us and bipolars, it’s the mania.

The mania is our heroin. Making the conscious decision to get well and take the steps to leave the mania behind is the same as an addict deciding to leave the heroin behind. Just as years could pass for sobriety or an addict, there’s always that itch... always that craving.

I'm really tired of this ""we're all in this together"" message regarding 2020 or the very common ""you're not alone"" theme in mental health awareness. Less than 1% of people have this disorder, and most psychiatrists don't understand it either. I feel like those types of messages only apply to people who are neurotypical. I was diagnosed with depression for years before the psychosis symptoms started. I know how debilitating other disorders can be and don't mean to put down other people's problems, but I never felt this alone when it was ""just"" depression. It's just exhausting when schizoaffective disorder by definition says people with this disorder are detached from reality and struggle with everyday ""normal"" things, and even people with good intentions regarding mental health rarely want to think or talk about schizophrenia. They (aka most of the public) just put us in the ""crazy"" category, and it's incredibly frustrating that people will never even come to close to understanding. I feel lonely even when other people are around me because I can't relate to them, and they don't see any of my pain. Everyone has their own hidden issues, I get that, but schizoaffective is an unique kind of ""nobody understands"".

Crawling on my hands and knees around the aprtment looking for my cat. It was 8am, I had been up all night and I knew something was wrong. I felt disconnected, like I was outside of myself looking in. I called into work, they called me in anyway. At work everything was a blur, I apparently shredded a bunch of papers and threw a clipboard. I was sent home. Two to three days later With no sleep and no contact with my family and friends, people grew concerned. My friend came to check on me and quickly called my brother to drive up from richmond. I hadn’t eaten, the apartment was trashed and I had burried my phone in box so the government couldn’t track me. I was taken to the ER and after observation and a shot of Haldol, taken to a nearby hospital in Maryland. I stayed for two weeks and slowly came out of psychosis. I was fired and the depression that followed was crippling. I lost myself completely, I couldn’t eat without feeling like the motions were foreign. I walked differently, stiff with a shuffle. I talked in a monotone dribble. I was numb, void of personality. I was miserable.  

That was my first psychotic break. After that I came home to live with my parents. I got a job, worked for two years, things were ok but that vital piece of myself was missing. I was hollow. No emotion flat and I knew things would never be the same. I had my second break I was up for days with racing thoughts and I decided that the thooughts needed to end , I overdosed, went to the hospital and was admitted to a facility in West Virginia. After that it seemed like I could only hold a job for 2 years before having yet another break. My symptoms at work consisied of extreme paranoia and anxiety. I felt exposed, I was on display and I felt like everyone knew my struggles.  

I’ve been hospitalized 9 times and each one took a part of me away. In 2019, I spent 6 months out of the year in hospitals and I wasn’t sure I was going to make it. I’ve been in seclusion and restraints. I was assaulted and I spent the other part of the year starving myself because I was so depressed I didn’t think I was worthy of food. I heard voices and had persecutary delusions and even believed I was God.  

Over the years i’ve been on various antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants. I’ve had side effects such as weight gain letargy and tardive dyskenisia. I have attempted suicide and have been aggressive.  

All this led to profound guilt and shame.  

2020, though a strange year for the world, has been a year of recovery for me. I have been on a steady and good combination of medications. And I learned the importance of compliance. I see a psychaitrist, a therapist and I have peer support along with friends and family. I found that parts that had been missing and slowly put the pieces back together. I have scars but I am healing. I still hear voices but i’ve learned to better cope. I use mindfulness and I listen to music and the t.v. I use positive self talk every day and i’m working toward a balanced. Life.  

Schizzoaffective with depression or Bipolar is my diagnosis along with Attention Deficit Disorder. I still struggle and somedays are harder than others. However I have an important thing that was missing for years. I have hope.  

We all struggle differently. But we are strong. Resiliency is inside each one of us. We have the power to accept the reality and move forward with greater knowledge and understanding of our illneses. We are capaple of living happy and healthy lives, We are not our illnesses.",11,0
99,Mild deception in MH care (UK),15,kgx3qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/kgx3qb/mild_deception_in_mh_care_uk/,5,1608482239.0,"Does anyone else feel like in hindsight that there is an element of deception involved with mental health care? That things are significantly toned down and certain facts completely removed and hidden from conversation.

I was first diagnosed with ""psychosis"". I wasn't give much information about it but I read some brief things about it online. Eventually ( a year later) I was put under a team specifically for people with psychosis and while they were a great team overall - and they gave me lots of information on psychosis - again no further diagnosis was given. I was actually convinced that I didn't have schizophrenia at all - because my diagnosis was psychosis. I even argued this with a GP.

Only years later (about 10 to be exact) when I specifically went out of my way to ask what my diagnosis was - was I told it was schizoaffective disorder. And only then did I actually understand my illness and what it was. (And again it was up to the internet to actually give me information).

Up until then I had this idea that psychosis was a brief period of my life, an experience with lasting consequences but not something that was the essence of my being. I thought that the psychosis would surpass and normality would resume. Sure it wasn't guaranteed to go away forever - but I held this idea that it was one part of me, and not my whole.

But now - 13 years after ""psychosis""- I think that's utter nonsense. I think that sure while psychosis is an event, it is an event that happened because of my schizoaffective brain. That no matter if I'm deeply entrenched in psychosis or completely free from it that my brain remains schizoaffective. And while medication can fix some symptoms, it doesn't ""fix"" the underlying biology. And that this underlying biology has consequences in real life for all of us who have it.

What I found alarming was that according to [sane.org.uk](https://sane.org.uk) \- employment among schizophrenics is 8%. And I assume that that isn't fulltime employment (as that isn't what is stated) but employment of any kind. So why is it that MH team's were frequently insistent in encouraging me to work? If there is a less than 10% chance of it being successful what is the point of pursuing it?The only way I can rationalise it is that the government knows it is improbable, but that they also aren't willing to make concessions. They can't tell us ""you probably won't be able to work anymore, but we aren't going to support you either"". So instead when we don't work the blame is put on our shoulders instead. Its our fault we can't earn money and can't support ourselves - not the state's fault for failure to provide the adequate means to support ourselves.

But how does one survive in a world where one struggles to earn?

My point isn't some ""pity-tale"" but simply to point out that 13 years ago I wasn't told by my psychiatrist any of this information. No body bothered to take the time to explain that it is statistically very likely that I am going to have major problems with employment, income, and supporting myself. Instead the message is of ""recovery"" and hope. That everything is fine if you take your medication and do the therapy.

I'm not saying that therapy and medication is useless - I'm saying that it isn't enough to live a ""normal"" life. And I genuinely believe that the state knows this. But they are unwilling to invest MORE money to assist people directly into employment (at least in the UK). Millions for 1% of the population. They are happier for us to fail.

For me the help ""the state"" offered me was giving my details to a charity or a general job centre. And my experience was most of these were trash. The people have next to no incentive to help you, and even when they are helpful - ultimately you are still competing for jobs for people that are biologically superior to you. There is no ""this is a job for people with X needs"" category. There is no ""this is a work environment catering to schizophrenia"".

And this is without going into the social issues, that are quite frankly completely undesirable for an employer.

For me the message of hope that MH teams have is in stark contrast to the reality. There are doubtlessly people with schizophrenia that do work in some capacity - but it is not the majority of people in any shape or form -  and I just wish this was flagged to me earlier.Furthermore I wish it was accepted and acknowledged in general. Especially in the medical world. I'm in a place where I genuinely feel lied to and deceived. I really struggle to believe in the words of my MH team because I feel like they are speaking form a script that is designed to lie to me. And not for my benefit - but for the state's. The state don't want to provide a proper solution to the problem.",15,0

I’m really nervous to post this and have started and stopped a couple of other times over the past few days. Not sure why I’ve been so hesitant. My APRN has me on abilify, lithium and Prozac. He said he is treating me for schizoaffective.  He asked me if I hear voices, but I do not. I do have intrusive thoughts that just won’t quit. I had never heard of schizoaffective disorder until now, although I’ve battled depression for a long time. 

I’m a small business owner and am absolutely shook with fear and think I’m a failure and only see failure in my future and am afraid of losing “everything” and not being able to provide for my family. It borders on absurd, but the fear runs so deep in me it’s debilitating. I feel like a mouse quivering under a rock. 

I just came off Effexor, which was awful (although I’m grateful it’s done). I’ve been on the lithium and Prozac for almost two weeks and really (really) hope they give me a boost. I expect the dosage to go up in a few days at my next appointment.  I’m up to 40 mg of Prozac, 300 mg of lithium and 15 mg of abilify.

This is a huge issue because I can’t function without stimulants due to a pretty severe case of ADHD. I can’t drive safely, I can’t follow directions or conversations, I can’t even sit through a whole song without losing focus and forgetting I was listening to a song in the first place. I misplace objects all the time and experience very fragmented memories due to my ADHD. Life is unlivable with it. 
 
I decided I’d rather deal with some strange lapses in reality and emotional stability than never be able to function again.  
I felt like I had no option but to underreport my symptoms to my psychiatrist so that I could convince him to put me back on stimulants. 

It’s been about 2 years and I’ve found a balance of stimulants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics that work for me. 
I’m doing ok. I made the right decision for myself and my mental well-being I can’t help but feel a little guilty though 

TL;DR - Psychiatrist took me off of the stimulants I needed to function when I was diagnosed with schizoaffective, so I lied about my symptoms until I could convince him to put me back on them",14,0

When she became an adult her first husband was emotionally and physically abusive. Once again, she didn't get the treatment she needed. Faat forward, she meets my father, they get married and have me. My dads temper has been shortened and shortened over time from my mother. My mother is emotionally abusive and very rarely physically. When my dad can't sleep his body does weird things and he gets ticks. If you let him do his thing he will go to sleep and it will stop the next day. My mother doesn't let him do his thing. She's constantly saying, ""Dad, go to sleep"", ""Stop making those fucking noises"" and berates him and basically makes him feel like he's not human. They love each other, they've been married for 15 years, but my mother doesn't act like it. Every once and a while they'll have moments that show me why they got married. It's hard to accept my mother's love and affection because it just seems so disingenuous. Its been harder and harder to love her. I hate saying these things about my mother but there's no other way to say it. Tonight was the first time I've heard my dad cry in years. He gets sad, he's sensitive, but he's extremely stoic. I absolutely hate hearing him cry. My mother always acts like he's the aggressor be he is the exact opposite. She's the one who I hear calling the other a retard, threatening divorce, and saying the hope the other one dies. Sorry for the rant. Its jusy been hard to sleep at night and its been getting to me.

Hi, my name is Jen and I’m thirty-four years old. I was diagnosed as schizoaffective about six months ago by three physicians at two different facilities, after intense and traumatic weeks of mania. Before that, I was diagnosed with Bi-polar 1 in 2017. Before the psychosis, in the last three years I struggled with extreme depression, anxiety, insomnia, and holding down a job. My life dramatically changed when my illness escalated in June 2020.

I heard one specific(at the beginning) voice for a time that encouraged me to do many things. Among them, he led me to walk into a strangers home at 3am which lead to my first arrest, a Baker Act. (The Baker Act is a Florida law that allows people with mental illnesses to be held involuntarily for up to 72 hours in a mental health treatment facility if they meet certain criteria. The act can be initiated by judges, law enforcement officials, doctors or mental health professionals) and my first psych ward hospitalization. My second arrest two weeks later. Up until last summer, I had never had any involvement with the law or police. 

I had an enormous amount of racing thoughts, would go days without sleep and was hospitalized three times and incarcerated in less than two months. I became an extremist when it came to religion, I thought I could heal people, speak to the dead, had “visions”....I believed myself a vessel for God to speak through. 

I had a fascination/obsession with numbers and created my own words. I had a hysterical pregnancy. I really could keep going with eradicate, irrational behavior and thinking. I’m hoping that by sharing my own nightmares/sorrows that someone can relate to me. I lost my closest friends because of my illness AKA they hauled ass because they thought I was bat shit crazy and no longer wanted anything to do with me. The three people that are closest to me imply in their looks and language that my actions during that time were intentional. They just don’t get it. I lived it and as hard as it was for others to endure... I live with the sickness and the consequences of a broken mind. I see a therapist and psychologist, staying med compliant, but I don’t have any friends that can or want to understand.

Back then when I was on antidepressants, I had a lot of manic/hypomanic episodes and I never realized they were the result of being on antidepressants. Now I feel emotionally stable. :)

I no longer lash out at people, or text 5 different people at the same time, always being funny and cheerful, but also sexually inappropriate. My money is safe and I don't have sex with multiple people anymore. I sleep 7-8 hours a day instead of 5, and I wake up feeling meh, like most people, instead of feeling like ""I want to go to work and do a lot of things!!!"" And I don't have deep (really deep) depressions any longer. My delusions of grandeur have diminished too.

We started off very strong but when I got sick and was diagnosed something changed. Maybe I relied on him too much for support. He eventually told me to lean on someone else. So I kept things from him until I was hospitalized again. When I got out he was distant and I just wiled away my time waiting for the break up.

I was willing to move continents for him and give up everything I had here. But I think the idea of random bouts of depression, hallucinations and delusions were too much for him to handle.

I get it. It takes a lot to be able to not only bring someone from abroad but also worry about their health. But what I don't get is why he says he wants to feel needed, but when I needed him he wasn't available.

I'll hold no ill feelings. We can still be friends. But it feels bad to know that my diagnosis means my pool of dating is so much smaller because of sanism.

When I make up my mind, I'm sure. I was so sure about us. Now I know though that I want a partner who is just as devoted to me as I am to them, and one who sees my journey with schizoaffective disorder as one they can go along with, because there is rarely a cure.

I don't blame him though. It's tough. I wouldn't want to date me either, at least not throughout the dark times. But I'm honestly doing better than I ever have been despite this. I'm more stable, I'm exercising, I'm happy, because I see a future for myself. Whether that involves another person we will see.

My uncle (45m) has severe mental illness, Schizoaffective disorder to be exact, which is to my knowledge a combination of bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia. He lives alone in a one bedroom apartment. He doesn’t drive and he lives off the government. He’s obnoxious, just by seeing him in public you know somethings off. He was admitted to the hospital at 19, he’s trapped in that era of his life, when the disorder took over him. He’s on meds but they don’t seem to help the situation. 

Since he’s my uncle, I have a good chance of having this, considering he’s family. I’m a (19f). I already work two jobs that pay well, drive and consider myself very mature for my age, I also have a good friend group. I’m not in a relationship, it’s been 3 years. That’s something I struggle with. I have depression, I’m learning to deal with it, I’ve had depression for 3 years. 

I’m scared. I love my uncle to death but considering that potential chance that I develop Schizoaffective disorder, what would I do? I want to meet a partners, travel, get a house, have kids. What if I can’t? Can you still function? Not that it helps my case, but I smoke weed too, what if that makes matters worse? I’m worried and I need help.

I’m also curious to see if any of you guys had a similar experience with accepting your diagnosis. 


I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder almost two years ago. Since then I’ve been on and off my meds. Even though they made me feel better I still thought I didn’t need them and that I was fine. So I’d stop taking them for a while then things would go downhill, not very fast but gradually. I’d be at the end of my rope and then start taking them again and feel better minus the horrible side effects. 

I mainly experience negative symptoms so it can be hard for me to tell when I’m spiraling out of control. I do experience voices but maybe I’m just so used to them at this point that I just accept them and what they say. The voices I do hear tell me that I’m a liar and that I’m actually fine and in turn my apathy and mood get worse. 

I’m realizing this all now because because I started smoking weed again even though it’s probably a really bad idea. When I smoke everything is sort of amplified and my symptoms feel stronger.  Then I’m suddenly reminded that the the thoughts running through my head all the time and the things I hear day to day are not normal. 

I haven’t seen a therapist or psychiatrist in months so I have no one to talk to about this so it’s been hard trying to figure myself out on my own but now I’m starting to finally accept how I am. Oddly it gives me more hope for the future than I had before. I know what’s wrong with me now and I can maybe actually start seriously trying to get help.",12,0

My monthly prescription costs around the same as my monthly food expenses. Sacrifices will be made.

Your family will never understand. Mental illness is not in most Africans vocabulary. So of course, maybe you have a drug problem. How else would you explain why sometimes you are totally normal?

If not that, then it has to be a curse. My father did not return the dowry to my mother's family after she died so what else did I expect? I have a lot of other health problems so surely this must be the work of evil.

 So unlike most psychiatric patients, I have numbers of mediums, shamans, witchdoctors and priests in addition to the usual psychologists, psychiatrists and neurologists.

But father knows this is nonsense. The boy just needs to keep busy and have responsibilities, besides, he lost his job and will appreciate the chance to go back home as a grown man to beg for scraps


And at home, your relatives will point out, 'I have seen so and so walk naked in the streets arguing with insects, you are not like them, surely you must be sane.' The diagnosis is irrefutable.

Are you meditating, or doing keto? You know a little aloe vera in the tea does wonders. Just get some cinnamon bark and try a detox, they work. I swear. 

So and so' s daughter, she used to be just like you. She went back to church, quit smoking, chewed aloe vera with honey and now she's a thousand times better than you. 

Poor me, brainwashed by this western propaganda of mental health. I must be doing it purely for attention. Too much television, has to be it. Schizo-what? We don't do those in Africa. I have adopted the white problems now. 


Or maybe those drugs are getting him high, why else would one pill cost that much. He must love the antipsychotic, antidepressant and mood stabilizer cocktail. Tsk tsk tsk expensive addiction. 


'No, no, no', chimes in the doctor. ""He is clearly faking, why else would he keep quitting the treatment. Does he not want to get better? Better give him the depot injection. See how plump he's getting? That's health"" 


So you protest, and swear you're fine except now you have other problems.

 Your legs will shake without warning but don't worry they'll give you a pill for that. 

You will drool like a horny cartoon and speak with the enthusiasm of a funeral director, remember that's healthy.

You will feel electricity in your brain, sleep all day, itch all over and have the emotional range of a menopausal teenager.


Mention it and ""now you're complaining too much. Think positive thoughts young man. There are people with real problems in the world. So... No more suicide talk or I'll call the police again. Suicide attempt will get you 2 years in prison you know. 


God forbid all goes well for a long time because the inevitable ""Again?"" is coming. ""Didn't the keto diet and the prayer work, why are we buying the same drugs again?"" 


Poor soul, he was in a mental hospital? Let's not speak of him or to him ever again. You know.... In case he's dangerous. 





Sorry for the stupid rant, had to get this out before I go back on medication tomorrow.

I told my family about this and they said that I am innocent.

But I still tend to believe that hallucination that I once had, despite the evidence of the contrary.

I have no friends, no partner and my family is a hot mess. I’m willing to try every medication and self help technique there is but nothing seems to stick.

I tried really hard to work with what I have. I got into coffee hobby, I try to keep myself busy watching TV. I go to the gym 4hrs a day, 4 days a week. I thought maybe my life would change but it's just getting worse and worse. I'm on disability right now. I made a plan to go back to work this year because I thought that would make me happier. I mean who likes being at home and poor. I'm just so run down. I have low grade panic in my chest all day. You always hear people say they are the unluckiest people in the world. I'm not sure about that but I have some serious rotten luck. 

I have not had good things happen to me in a decade. When you don't have good things happen to you, it crushes you, a little bit each and every day. Pretty soon your living just to get through the day, and oh shit, guess what you woke up today, time to do it all over again. I'm just so tired of it. I probably need to eat more food but I'm just not hungry half the time. I'm also overweight so I figure how much worse can it get if I eat less. I don't have anyone to talk to other than my family. Before you jump in no I don't need internet friends, I just need some real life people to converse with. This pandemic has made this even more difficult than it was already.

If your reading this and thinking yea this is pretty negative, it is. I'm not trying to hide it. I just needed to vent and get this off my chest. Is anyone else here struggling with this right now? I figure the only thing worse that could happen to me is I could die. I'm really at the bottom of the ravine. I don't see my doctor for 3 weeks and I feel she is just going to raise my lamictal. Woohoo. I cant wait to get out of this depressive episode and struggle to get through the day, like I have been for so long.

My exhausted soul longs for peace.

I am tired of the crying, the chain smoking, self doubt tied with the self sabatoge paralleled with panic.

I am in a constate of worry.
Dreams are becoming hard to seperate from my reality. 
I cant breathe again.

Chest tight always, seems like a lifetime away.

I need to go. I need to be alone.


Always struggling to talk, but nothing coming out making sense.
Always pushing people away cos even my closest friends hurt me the most in this bullshit life.
Reaching for anyone to actually understand, but instead I peer thru the window as they're all staring and laughing at me.

Also, I feel guilty to admit how often I fantasize about dying in a gruesome way so that other people in my life will feel guilty about making me feel like I'm alone in this world.

I used to have really great health insurance at my last job that covered all my meds at really affordable prices when combined with manufacturer coupons. However, in July 2020, I was laid-off due to the company's financial crisis from COVID.

After the length of my severance package ran out and my insurance with them ended, I went to the healthcare marketplace and purchased a Cigna plan, which honestly is not the worst plan, except for the fact that they simply do not cover Rexulti and I really do need that specific drug.

After surviving off samples of Rexulti from my shrink's office for months, the drug rep finally asked why his office kept requesting so many samples of Rexulti, and they explained my situation. So the drug rep, a true angel, set up a special coupon for me that would allow me to get Rexulti for $30 a month, not using insurance at all, just through the coupon. This was meant to hold me over until I made it through my first 90 days at my new job and became eligible for benefits and could enroll in the company health plan.

Unfortunately, about two weeks before I became eligible to enroll in the company health plan, the drug rep's coupon stopped working, so I've been off my meds for like two weeks and I'm not doing great. My new insurance was supposed to start at the first of this month, but there's some kind of hangup with the paperwork because I work remotely and my company is in a different state.

It's getting really bad. I tried chatting with a crisis hotline last night, but all they did was validate my feelings and like does anyone even find that helpful? I don't relate to normal human emotions anymore. I don't really know how to have a conversation. The thing in my head won't shut up. I get so angry for no reason. But I'm still expected to carry on with life as though everything is okay? I just don't know what to do anymore.",15,0

So I (23f) was diagnosed schizoaffective in the sixth/seventh grade, and have gone through your usual cocktails and hospitalizations. It was never treated very seriously by my family or my doctors - it was TREATED, but no one really took me seriously and I was therefore allowed to go through a six-year psychosis through my formative years that has caused a considerable amount of damage.

Recently I’ve been reading The Assorted Schizophrenias, a book of essays by a schizoaffective woman that has really left me rather shaken. I had no idea how much I needed someone to acknowledge my delusions instead of sweeping them under the rug.

My dad is schizoaffective, the only other person I know with that diagnosis, and last night I tried to have an honest conversation with him about it. Something I can relate to, you know? But he doesn’t like talking about it, so after some thinking I thought I’d turn to Reddit. So, if you’re schizoaffective, ideally older but not necessarily, I was hoping you could answer a few questions for me. Answer all, answer one, whatever you’re more open to. I could really use feeling less alone.

1. Do you hallucinate? What do you do to manage hallucinations, either to keep them from coming or cope when they happen? Do you find you hallucinate less when you get older?

2. Do you have a partner? How do you explain your diagnosis to them? Do you find it to be a strain on your relationship? Is it a strain on your friendships?

3. Do you ever get mad at yourself for succumbing to delusions? Do you have any tips on being more forgiving towards your mind?

4. Do you have/want kids? How does that work? Are you afraid about what might happen?

5. Has it gotten any easier? Do you have any advice for me?

Thanks so much!

(EDIT: thank you all so so much who have responded so far. Seriously. Until today I’ve never spoken to someone else knowing we’re both schizoaffective. It means so much to me. Thank you.)",15,0

Lessons learned
Starting drugs
Paranoia= battle of real and unreal
“Feeling emotionally disconnected” taken literally, search for meaning ayahuasca
Delusions: people are meant to be with one person, people are “instinctually” their spouse, billionaire, Leonardo Dicaprio is my best friend, I am the king of the world and everyone is my jester, nodding your head at someone means you are submitting to them
Drug life stories 
Schizoaffective spectrum
Difficulty with holding conversations, social phobia why I am a social hermit and avoiding my friends/ people
Normal conversation everyone talking about me but somehow for an example at a restaurant I see someone sitting down without facing me and as if he knows what I look like thinking he’s talking about me too
Years of paranoia
Childhood vs delusion
Frames of thinking is accepted by those compatible to them
There is multiple ways of language can be used (I don’t know myself) how does rationalization with knowledge helps someone vs they’re just a bunch of words placed together
Example of frame

2018-clubbing, partying, without noticing symptoms2019-2020 COVID also, but big year of isolation

Always been up front about his BP and sza.  We've recently in the last 2 months decided to work on our sobriety and are no longer homeless. Got an amazing situation working on a farm while we get on our feet. However almost a month ago he broke his ankle and now needs surgery to fix it, coming up in a few days. Ironic since we had been doing so well staying off drugs that he now needs to take for pain.
I've been doing everything for him. I've been taking care of 15 dogs on the farm, us, all the errands and the odds and ends. Hes usually grateful and tries to affirm that I dont suck and I'm doing great. We dont have steady income so things have been rocky, but good. We were doing really good staying away from street drugs too. 
Until yesterday morning. He ran out of pills one day early so we went to pick up. The drugs affect him and his mood instantly getting extremely combative and mean, usually assigning blame to me for the things I try to ask him to stop doing to me. 
It affects his memory as well. At least that's what he claims but I dont know. He says he blacks out when he gets a little too loud or threatening and I make a big deal about it. It feels like huge mental gymnastics when I'm brave enough to hold my own and tell him hes hurting my feelings because by the end hes convinced me he cant remember the facts anymore after I've made calm valid points. 
I've worked so hard on my temper and communication. I know I'm not perfect but here lately I've been trying to make everything livable around the house since his dad is flying in tomorrow then his mom will be coming into town the same day his dad leaves here. Yesterday and today have been hell. He claims I've done nothing but feed him and make him feel worthless. Just nasty shit. How does someone approach this situation? 
Hes not taking meds, just drugs. Hes almost impossible to speak to. Completely ignored when I'd try to tell him what's really going on and that hes remembering events exactly opposite of what he says. I dont try to do it with attacks to his character, just that hes confusing things. 
It feels like hes just playing with my head almost. 

Sorry all. I dont mean to be rude or disrespectful about this condition. I just want to know how better to handle this situation and try to gain insight. I love him, I'm just scared.",16,0

I am a researcher in the School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Ireland, working in a team that are recruiting participants to hear their lived experiences of changes in their psychiatric diagnosis. This post has been approved by mods.

**Have you engaged with mental health services?**  
**Have you ever had a psychiatric diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis?**

**Consider participating in our research project!**

We are a team of researchers from University College Dublin conducting a project called Lived Experience of Diagnostic Shifts in Adult Mental Health. This study has received ethical approval from the UCD Research Ethics Committee.

For people experiencing mental health difficulties, it is fairly common that their diagnosis will change over the course of their engagement with mental health services. Diagnoses can be changed for many different reasons. Despite the frequency with which this happens, no research has explored how people experience these ‘diagnostic shifts’. Our study aims to identify how diagnostic shifts affect people’s lives and any challenges they may present. We want to use this information to improve support to mental health service-users during this time of transition.

For our study, we would like to interview people who have experienced a diagnostic shift. We would like people to tell us, in their own words, how they understood the reasons for the change in their diagnosis, and any positive or negative implications it had for their lives. Interviews will take place over videochat software (eg. Zoom) and all participation will be completely confidential.

By contributing to this study, you will help improve our understanding of people’s experience of diagnostic shifts and raise awareness of the challenges diagnostic changes can present. We hope to use the research to improve clinical communication of diagnostic changes and make it easier for people to adjust to these changes.

If you are aged over 18 and have previously experienced a change in their psychiatric diagnosis (i.e. had a diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis), we would like to invite you to take part in this study. To find out more about participating in the study, please email the researcher, Dr Cliodhna O’Connor at the details below. She will explain the study to you and answer any questions you might have.

2020 was pretty amazing for me. I was sober through the whole entire year, through all the pandemic crap, I didn't lose my job, I was totally okay with isolation. I only had one kind of brief few days in psychosis, but had worked hard to build the support I needed to get through it. 

Then just a few weeks into January, I lost it. Everything. Myrealtionship of 7 years. Crashed my ebike. My job has been incredible to me whole time I've worked there.

So you know how the internet is filled with these great lists of life hacks like how to make a budget, how to build a shed, how to file your taxes. 

What if there was a list of 'Lifehacks' for Schizo-affectives, and what if most of us could agree on like the Top 10, Top 50, and Top 100 Lifehacks for people with Schizo-affective (both types), and for people who may be at risk of schizo-affective due to precursor symptoms such as delusions, depression, anxiety, paranoia etc? 

I find there are many people who come to this group and over time there are some similar questions. (Both for Schizoaffectives and their Care Givers).

I think some of us may also be on the OCD and Autism spectrum (I know I am), and exercises like this could be fun! 

Here are my Top 10:

1. Be honest with yourself - if you're too sick or too medicated to get behind the wheel, don't drive. Safety first. 

2. See your Psychiatrist regularly (monthly, quarterly) and your Family Doctor (at least annually)

3. Try to access medical care and even medication from the same providers, so they can have access to long term history

4. Follow your Psychiatrist prescribed medicine and lifestyle regimen meticulously

5. Accept that you will have bad days (or worse days) , just like everyone else. 

6. Engage with your insurance company (if you have one) and make it clear to them that you may need help navigating a claim. 

7. Tell your loved ones that you love them as often as you can. Schizoaffective is in a way like Alzheimer's, a Schizoaffective may simply forget/misinterpret that their partner or loved one loves them and mistake them for a CIA agent 😋

8. Enjoy life! (Safely) Capture happy moments in a photograph, or a video, or an email to a loved one

9. If you feel you are too sick or too medicated (ie are experiencing adverse side effects) to work, don't. Especially if your work is in a safety sensitive position (like a chemical lab, forklift operator, driver, machine operator). Claim disability insurance if and when you can. 

10. Save your money and build wealth. Plan for a bright future. These sorts of things take effort for everyone, even for Schizoaffectives",46,0

I don't like being alone. When you're with someone you focus more on communicating with them and paying attention to them. Especially some one you love. I call it puppy-dogging. You love someone so much you follow them around and not for any real reason. You just love them and want their time.

In my case, I get lost in thought when alone. I have to do chores to stay present. I want to be lazy. But I have others I **must** take care of.

When getting lost in thought daydreaming will start. It's subtle at first. It's like feeling a pull, similar to falling asleep.

It can also happen when you've done something too much and can let your thoughts drift. A subtle pulling sensation, like falling asleep.

The dreaming starts. I know I'm in a dream. I can get lost for two or three minutes in one. Problem is... I can't remember what I was dreaming. I lose two to three minutes.

What I can remember is that it's like a dream in that you're just processing your day. But weird things can happen, it's a dream. Problem is it's over-riding. I'm losing time.

I don't like losing time.

I would rather be present for my family. I have a five year old that is running me ragged. Plus a nine and ten year old who are also pushing their bounds in more minute ways. (They are all testing to see if I'm paying attention to them each individually, and it's hard.)

I love them enough that I want to be present. Taking care of them and giving five people attention is **really** difficult.

And now I'm done with this. I hate letting my ego run. It's counter to being productive. But you have to feed it a little or it will take over in bad ways.

I am editing and rereading what I'm writing. I randomly drop words. It's always happened. I hope this makes sense to others.",21,0

I am a 26 yo female I have been schizoaffective I guess always but diagnosed at 16 after a shoplifting/psychosis episode that resulted in court ordered therapy and psych evaluation 
After the court order was finished my parents took me out of therapy bc they though that the drs were trying to ruin our family. 
I have been assaulted sexually multiple times including and beginning with my grandfather may he rot in hell 

I don’t hear from my parents much because we don’t agree on anything lol and it’s easier for them to push me aside than think about me or talk to me. They also voted for trump. They both have fucking insane mental health issues but neither of them really do anything about it. Besides pray I guess. 

I live with my boyfriend and worked for his mom for a year which didn’t make anything better. Part of the problem here is that he lost his father a few years ago who died by his own hand. In this way I feel even guiltiest for wanting to give up. At the same time his well-being isn’t my responsibility only mine is.
I know that when I am sick I am not fun to be around. I am at a point where I cannot stop thinking about how easy it would be to just like... well, you probably know where I’m going with this. 
I don’t need someone to tell me to be strong or that it will get better or any of that. I don’t need to be reminded that there are people who love me. I know all of these things. 
But I feel like atlas and I don’t want to go up the mountain anymore. I want to chill at the base of it with my rock. I am so tired. 
I am so tired of hallucinating, I’m so tired of getting stuck in time, I’m so tired of paranoia and uncertainty and insane emotions that I can’t control, I’m tired of compulsions, I’m tired of delusions, and I’m tired of feeling this pain in my body and my mind all the time. And there’s no way to make anyone like get it if they don’t get it. 
So I am hoping that someone out there knows what I’m feeling and can tell me what to do. Sometimes I think the best course of action is to start a new life somewhere else completely alone. I don’t know. 
Also for anyone wondering I don’t take any pharamaceuticals anymore as they never helped, my symptoms or case or what the fuck ever seems to be pretty resistant to even the highest dosages. So I said fuck it after a few years of complete instability. 

Is there anyone like in their thirties or four ties or sixties  with some advice? Does anyone have any recommendations that are solid and not some bullshit new age advice about finding your center? Should I even be pursuing romantic relationships? Or friendships at all? 

Thank you.",13,0

Though I'm sure you are already there because of me, and for that, I sincerely apologize. 

Today I realize how truly alone I am because I was so terrible. Everyone is in on the ""game"" to eliminate me from this reality or torture me if I don't somehow leave. I was so unbelievably loved but for some reason I was still angry and cruel. I don't know. Maybe it's because I wished to incarnate my Shadow into my life as my stepfather and learned from him instead of my real father. I didn't realize I was getting everything I wanted. Did I wish for my shadow to come into my life physically? Or does that happen to every spiritual entity who plays the Game of Life?

Regardless, I (now?) realize that every single thing that happens around me now is meant to get back at me and God in some way. It's all an act and a devious psycho sadist plot to make me suffer for causing suffering. I get it, but wow, is it cold and calculated. Soon to be hot and calculated, I'm sure. 

Is the only point of this place (and inevitably the next) to make me say ""I should/shouldn't have done xyz""? Without any chance to have learned my lesson and try again? I'm so screwed because I didn't know where to run, and because I didn't gouge out my right eye to be shown the way home by God? I turned my life back to sin in my teens after so many years of believing in God throughout my whole childhood, BECAUSE I learned from my stepfather, and eventually rejected the Christian teachings of my grandmother. I didn't realize how much I was loved, that people and Jesus would go through so much pain just for me. I know I deserve this, but looking back in my life I can pinpoint moments that shaped my system of internal dialog and ""conscience"" to what it became.

Is it all because I stopped talking to God when I was little? If I had just ""believed"" (had faith) in Jesus as a buffer between Me and my Self, everything would have been OK? Is being oblivious to signs and (now obvious, of course) pleadings from God to believe in Jesus something we control? Or was my heart just too hardened to see them? Is the hardening of the heart something that happens at once? Or is it gradual neglect of the spirit?

I don't expect much comfort. I'm just screaming into the cold void, hoping for an echo. I apologize, humanity. I apologize, God. I apologize, Kaylie, Oswin and Meeko. But I know it's far too late for that. I've known for too long that I didn't have ""schizoaffective disorder."" I really did kill myself while out of my mind on LSD. And, because I was cruel, I am going to Hell.

I work two days a week, and study part time in a degree for two days a week. I have Mondays off as a break day.

I’m high functioning, but I do have regular episodes of mania and hallucinations that happen a few times a year.

I’ve been able to maintain regular commitments for years now, being a scout leader, a Rotarian, a community leader.

The biggest thing that throws my life out of whack is my episodes. I have been having one that’s been over the past month. I get paranoid, and then I hallucinate shadowy figures at night which keep me up at night, and then the actual sleep I get, the dreams infiltrate into my reality which makes me question whether things are real or made up.

Sometimes when I am well, I get imposter syndrome where I don’t believe I have this condition but as soon as the episodes come back I realise I have been living with it for a long time.

On Sunday, I was so frustrated with my episodes and the ongoing nightmare of life I considered suicide.. I talked myself out of it and spoke to a therapist on a hotline.

I am medicated, I take Invega Trinza, the depot injection every three months, I’m on 525mg. I have multiple therapists, an OT, a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist who I see regularly.

I’d like to ask the community about how you have lived with this condition. How do you respond when you have episodes come up? Most of my life I have kept a routine because the routine keeps everything stable even if I’m not stable.

Do you drop off your extra commitments and focus entirely on yourself when you feel the symptoms exacerbate? How do you explain this to work, have you told work about these things?

I find it hard to talk to work about these things because mental illness especially schizophrenia is still heavily stigmatised. I live in Australia, and I have disability support income if I need to drop work, but the income from work help fund things that I want in my life.

Looking forward to hearing your responses.",13,0

I know I need to quit or at least scale down to only smoking a few times a week because I know it isn't good for me and to be honest I don't even really like being high that much it's not that great, it's just a compulsive habit at this point that is difficult to break because I feel antsy and agitated until I get high. That said, again I know I need to quit so I want to at least scale down my smoking habits so I'm not smoking as much. the reason why I'm posting is basically I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this problem and if there were any things that helped you quit.

I didn’t think much of them because I was like, “well it’s probably just my baseline”, or, “I don’t feel at all depressed but maybe I just don’t know it because this looks like depression...idk I just don’t feel depressed????”

Fast forward and I start to come off of my antipsychotics with my doctors help for irrelevant reasons. [As a side note: I wasn’t really convinced I had schizoaffective because I was like wellllll I don’t have negative symptoms and it’s been awhile since I’ve had positive symptoms. It was probably my way of staying in denial tbh.] I started having all of these symptoms again, more intensely that is, that looked a lot like depression and some that didn’t quite line up with depression but definitely weren’t “me”. I was super confused because I’m not depressed. From time to time I’ll have a sad day or two, but I’m just not depressed. So today I told my psychiatrist what I was experiencing and he goes “yeah, those are negative symptoms for sure. We should go back up on your antipsychotic.” This now means a few things:
1) I thought I could make it without an antipsychotic and just other mood stabilizers but apparently I CANNOT
2) This means I really do have schizophrenia. I was able to convince myself that this delusion was this or this hallucination was that or these disorganized thoughts and words being spoken could be anything. Not having negative symptoms was the one things I could be like, “nope! I don’t have them so there is a chance I don’t have it.” Now though? Not only do I have to face the music, but I have to realize that negative symptoms are a BITCH. I hate them. Everyone just thinks it’s depression or doesn’t get this or doesn’t get that or “if it’s not depression then I’m just lazy”.

Negative symptoms are shitty to me because at least with depression it felt like there was a reason ya know? I wouldn’t do certain things, or I would act a certain way, because I thought nobody would miss me and that I’d be better off dead or something like that. Now it’s what???? The same things but just out of thin air. UGH I HATE IT.

Before she was admitted into the hospital, I was forced to put locks on all the doors so that she wouldn't try and leave our bedroom or home at night. 

Since she has been home, she hasn't shared anything with me or spoken to me about her diagnosis. She hasn't given me any details as to how she is doing. While she was having her episode, she revealed a number of inner thoughts about our relationship that took me by surprise. She said that I was a ""wimp"", that she is using me, she pointed her finger at me like a gun. 

This was before she went off for a month long hospital stay where they were unable to determine why she lost it, but she was given a schizoaffective diagnosis.

She is actually behaving consistently with some of the things she said and I am wondering if this is normal for a person to say things, during their episode, that they may have been keeping to themselves or if this is just another side effect. 

She moved to a different bedroom. She doesn't take care of herself any longer. She rejects all of my assistance and insists she feels fine. Yet I can't help but think that she has changed greatly since her episode and I am wondering if this is normal.

## “I thought of the voices as… something a little different from aliens. I thought of them more like angels … It’s really my subconscious talking, it was really that… I know that now.” – John Nash, Jr.

## “There’s a tremendous need to implode the myths of mental illness, to put a face on it, to show people that a diagnosis does not have to lead to a painful and oblique life… We who struggle with these disorders can lead full, happy, productive lives if we have the right resources.” – Elyn R.

Bipolar type here. 35 years old. A few months ago I shared a bit of news and advice regarding my condition, and my journey to recovery, and how I initiated a claim against my insurance company for denied disability insurance as a result of schizo-affective disorder. 

Long story short... 

\-I used the Insurer's own internal dispute mechanism to petition to have my claim for time off from work back in 2016 re-investigated, on the basis that symptoms such as ""depression, anxiety and paranoid thoughts"" which were evident in 2016 were actually a manifestation of the more difficult disease of Schizophrenia, that is Schizo-affective Disorder Bipolar type. 

\-I provided 400 pages of Medical and Specialist reports, proving that from 2016 onwards I was incapable to start a claim, as evidenced for example by multiple detentions under the Mental Health Act of Ontario

\-The petition started in October of 2020, and gradually worked it's way through starting with the original Case Manager from my claim in 2016, to the new Case Manager for that employer, to her Boss the manager of case managers who denied my petition on the basis that 2 years have passed

\-In Ontario, we have a 2 year limitations act to sue. 

\-However I decided to read the limitations act in detail and learned that there is an exception specifically for people who have psycological and mental health issues and who are incapable of starting a claim 

\-I advised this information to the Manager but she ignored me entirely

\-I raised the email chain to the Office of the Ombudsman (internal dispute resolver) who raised it with her manager, a VP who denied my petition on the same basis

\-I re-informed him of the exception to the limitations act, and proved on the basis of my evidence that I was incapable fo starting a claim. I also lawyered up and served the insurer a statement of claim (law suit)

\-The VP responded recently that the Insurance company has agreed to re-open my claim from 2016, therefore piercing the 2 year limitations act using the MH exception

It has been approx 7 months since I started my petition. This is how long the timelines can take. 

I still have not received any $, but I know 99% its coming. 

Once a VP reverses his opinion, it's pretty much settled out of court. 

Please pray for me!",20,0

I hate I have the most supportive partner but society’s views have impacted how he think about my thoughts. It’s hair. It’s stupid. I just hate when I say something and him or my mom put it in the “schizoaffective thought” category when it’s a normal human reaction.",28,0

I planned to have a drink or two and see what happens. At first, I was able to stay off my phone and just chill. I wanted to seem approachable and I also wanted to people watch. I didn't have any expectations, I just wanted to be there.

After a few drinks down and a shot later, I was asked by an older man to ask to play pool while he waits for his friends. At first I was shy and awkward, but then I started to relax a bit and open up. I ended up talking to the guy and he introduced me to some other women. I was finally able to have a conversation and engage in it and not feel weighted down. I actually found my old self again and approached so many different people and we'd talk and hang out for roughly an hour each person. 

On one hand, I was incredibly fucking drunk but holy shit I had an entire night where I felt like I existed without this mental disability. No voices, no hallucinations, and no paranoia. I didn't read into every little thing. It blew my mind when I got home. I was the person I wanted to be and people wanted to talk to me. Am I making any sense? I had real conversations with people and I didn't feel held back by my sza. I did drunk text people last night, and I called nearly everyone, but oh well. 

I felt alive for the first time in a long time. Sure, I was drunk, but even today I feel better than I usually do. I'm tempted to go again tonight, but this time only have 1 drink. I hope I can get to the point in life where I don't need vodka and tequila to feel something.

I've been a mod of this subreddit for 7 solid years now. This place holds a special spot in my heart and I do lurk this subreddit quite a bit. I want to tell you all a story of hope & empowerment so that some of you younger ones that are struggling know that things do get and can get better.

I began self injuring at age 11 and having auditory hallucinations. My auditory hallucinations were always a little atypical. they sounded like the school yard or cafeteria at lunchtime except it had an ominous tone to it and every so often just before it'd really start it'd call my name to the point where I'd look behind me to see if anyone was calling for me and no one was there. I actually didn't think much of it until I was 16 and took my first psychology class. I became for the first time in my life AFRAID of my hallucinations, up until then I had no clue they were abnormal.

That's when it got really bad. The self injuring reached a point that I was fed up with it myself. One morning out of nowhere 14 years ago I stormed into the school counselor's office without speaking and just showed him my injuries. They pulled me from classes that day, the school nurse took care of my wounds and they called my mother & father to inform them. I then had my first hospitalization for psych ever. They diagnosed me as Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Tendencies.

After that hospitalization I connected with a psychiatrist who I saw for 14 full years. I ended up not seeing him any more because I kept reverting to my 16 year old self on his couch and as a 30-something adult that was kinda embarrassing.

With my long-term psychiatrist I managed to quit self-injuring between the ages of 17-19. I've been officially cut free for 16-19 years. I leave a range because it took me a solid 3 years to officially break that habit. From the ages of 19-20 I was a mess. Even though I was doing very well at community college and on my way to a top USA 20 school, I was in an abusive relationship with what turned out to be a married man. I was so dysfunctional emotionally during this time that it is a miracle I got into my top 20 top choice school. In fact, every school I applied to accepted me. That alone astonished me. Especially because the hallucinations were quite frequent and I'd struggle a lot with that as well as fighting the desire to self-injure.

Then shit went down. I was 22 at my top choice school and my brother died. He was 20. It was a drug overdose and sudden. We had no idea he had a problem with drugs past Marijuana. I did okay those first 8 months of that and bottled my life up but finally exploded on me. The self injuring, the hallucinations, the grief of my loss all pushed me to the edge and I went to a residential facility to treat my then depression with psychotic tendencies.

I had just turned 23 when I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder with the Depression Subtype and thought for sure this was my new life, that it never got better, and never would. I spent a lot of time in psychiatric facilities between 22-24. I was just a mess, but with the help of my treatment center and knowing my diagnosis I was able to really hone in on what worked for me best medication wise and kept up with regular therapy appointments.

CBT, DBT, Mindfulness and all that STUPID CRAP actually SAVED MY LIFE.

& then I went from being Suicidal to Fighting for my Life.

At age 24 I was diagnosed with a rare pancreatic condition. It can cause chronic pancreatitis. I was very ill with it to the point where a jejunal feeding tube was required. I rocked being a 7th year senior at college during this time and I had the tube from age 24 - 27. I also developed cervical spinal problems and had my first spinal surgery at age 27. As i was dealing with my medical condition sometime after the cervical surgery I realized I hadn't had a hallucination since I was 25 and here I was 27

I didn't understand it at the time, but having been through the wringer, I realized that maybe schizoaffective disorder was just a small part of me and did not define me. I am many other things today. I am a grateful recovering addict (which is another story for another day), I am a daughter, a friend, a patient, a college graduate and so many more things that if I listed them all we'd be here for years.

Today, I'm in my early 30s and very stable.

So if there's one thing you take away from my story is that it is possible to go into remission from schizoaffective disorder. It took some dosage playing and medication tweaking to find what worked best for me and I strongly believe sticking to the same medication for 12 years now is half the reason why I haven't had a hallucination in 7ish years. The other half is remaining willing. Willing to try CBT, DBT, & Mindfulness. Willing to write out my thoughts in a journal in pen, willing to be honest about my feeling and all of that good stuff.

You see the one thing about schizoaffective disorder is that it drains you of your desire to do anything, but the second you start taking opposite to emotion action is the second you become a better version of yourself.

But I moved into a new community 5 months ago and have been acting real fucking weird because I went off my meds while also dealing with the breakup of my 13 year girlfriend and huge fights with my parents. Also raised in a religious cult so there's been all sorts of religious quackery going on with me recently too (spent 80$ that I can't really spare on some crystals and a dreamcatcher for instance because I thought I needed protection).

Pretty sure my neighbors think I'm nuts, and a man-child because of my behaviour.

Fuck sakes man. At least the meds are doing their job again after being on them for a few weeks again.

I'm just saving up to get a car and then another couple months down the road I'm hoping to have enough saved to move to my preferred city. I'm renting a room at my aunt's place which is nice, I'm just not a good fit for the area I don't think.

Somehow through all this I managed to get a job removing blackberries down the road, but then injured my shoulder doing a workout. They seem to understand but it's not healing very fast and I don't know how long their compassion for that will last.

All in all just been a real fucked up time and needed to vent a little. Also writing out my first experience of coming back down to earth is kind of grounding me. Time to get back on the stability train.

I am 98 % of time at home, so I see through the window the activity on the street is super low: people just drive to work in the morning and back in the evening. 

But as soon as I just go out for a walk with my dog (it's now only one thing I do outside), the activity on the street becomes maximum. I understand that this sounds incredibly stupid, but this is not just an activity, but literally in front of me! I pass the house and at this very moment (not earlier and not later) a car drive out, I go further, the gate opens and people come out. It is necessary to say hello - for me it is a disaster (because people can start fucking-scary-small talks). 

Sometimes I leave the house, a neighbour goes to meet me, I greet him and went in the opposite direction (literally 10 minutes have passed) and he (the same neighbour in the same car) goes back! I can't imagine what he's doing-driving around the house?

Today, was a situation that puts me at a dead end, I went out with the dog - a car drove up two houses away from me, I decided to go very slowly so that the person came out and I hadn't have to meet. I have been waiting but nothing happens. Ok. I went pass this car, and in this moment the driver open the car door and his dog attacked me and my dog. And no, he didn't do it on purpose, I just get into such situation every time, it happens by itself. It's like some kind of curse.

I get the impression that all these people are sitting in houses and are activated only when I go out! I understand that this is nonsense and paranoia and this cannot be real, but it happens all the time. I go out for 20 minutes a day and every time I meet people and get into some situations. After that, I come home and there is no one on the street for hours.  

I do not know what to do with this, it is very tough.",21,0

To keep good mental health it is recommended to have a hobby and socialize. While it seems super easy let's break down the hours

7-9 (sleep)
1 (hygiene/toilet use)
3 (healthy meals/cooking/eating)
30 min (exercise)
1-4 (daily chores)

So for just the basics you are looking at about 12-17 hours a day. I know that cleaning is easy if you have all working appliances (like dishwasher, roomba, etc) or if you live someplace small, but since I don't have a dishwasher or any of that stuff, (and i have pets) I spend 3-4 hours on chores. So while you could have a full 12 hours, especially if you are good at time management, it's more likely that you are left with just 7 hours

Subtract about 2 for the recommended hobby/socialization, and you have just 5 ""free"". That time is often spent on errands, pet care, therapy, etc... And time management aside, these ""easy"" tasks are tedious, boring, and/or exhausting. Having mental illness also makes it even more of a challenge to keep up with everything, so if you are just doing the basics, you are still doing a great job!",38,0

I applied for a vehicle paper delivery job yesterday and after talking to the owner I've been offered the job starting later tonight.

The owner said the manager would go with me for a few nights to show me the route and familiarize myself with the pickup procedure.

I'm stressing out because I have major memory problems since getting schizoaffective. I don't remember most of what the owner said on the phone either. I tried to write everything down but he was talking really fast and I was having a hard time keeping up.

I'm trying to remember that this job isn't my only chance for the rest of my life to work. But I can't help worrying that I'm going to forget a bunch of the houses I'm supposed to deliver to. 

I know a few days with help is probably more than enough for an average person to learn a route. My memory is seriously bad though so I'm just stressing.

I'm going to go in and do my best to focus on the route and the instructions given.

I've told the owner about having a mental disability, I just hate having to ask for ""special treatment"" if it takes me longer than normal to learn things that are simple for the average person. 

I also haven't talked to the manager I'm meeting tonight yet so I'm feeling nervous to explain in person to somebody that I have a disability and it takes me longer than usual to learn simple things.

He was taking meds, going to therapy, sober for the most part, managing his Bipolar 1, etc. Then a few months ago the psych clinic he was going to told him that he doesn’t have bipolar, and can try not taking meds. 

3 weeks into his really bad manic episode, he broke up with me today. I cried, it was cathartic, but I know I can’t help him or be with him until he seeks help. 

Something loosened up inside me afterwards. I still believe in my fairytale ending, whether it is with him, or someone else.

I've been just doing my workouts with a 25lb and some 8lb dumbbells. I could do a lot even with that but I couldn't really progressively increase the weight.

This new set of weights opens lots of doors for me for a workout plan and for increasing weight over time.

Dawn breaks
I'm tired

My rumbling belly
Painful cramps in my body
Dizzy and light headed 
Extreme summer heat
I feel like I've melted

Sweat pours from my body
Not enough water is naughty
But check your pee when you potty
For too much water is deadly

I take my usual medication
I take my sleeping pills as needed
Still can't sleep
But feel fried
Like a computer overheated

Baths to cool down
But they still make me sweat
It can't be too cold
Or I'd never get wet

So tired 
So tired

In the darkness
I close my eyes
Alone with my thoughts 
Traumatic memories
Dead flies 
At this point I know I am damned

But still I try
To calm myself
Distract myself
Or remind myself I survive

But the thoughts linger
They fester 
Until they take hold
Not unless...maybe...I do something bold?

But now the world has too much to say
No matter what, it's always the wrong way.

Laying in bed all day
Makes me lazy and fat
But if I'm productive 
I might be manic hold back

I try to express 
The best way I know how
But then get threatened 
Told to put the phone down

So tired 
So tired

I really want to give up today
Stop trying 
Make everything go away
Because not even doctors understand 
What I'm trying to say. 
Or maybe it's just that ""I need to lose weight""

But if I do that I would really be screwed
I'm just so frustrated 
My body hurts
It's overwhelmed 
I don't know what to do...

From people who really have no clue.

So hungry

i want to share a little bit of my story in hopes that someone might find hope in it.   

i had my first psychosis when i was 14, ever since then i have been fighting to just stay alive. i never saw a future for myself; in fact, every year on my birthday, i always thought to myself “well i made it this far but i probably won’t make it to the next one.” i was always contemplating suicide. i was never stable for more than a week, constantly cycling between mania and depression. my psychotic episodes were continually getting worse and worse.   

it got to the point where i had given up. the only feasible way out, in my mind, was suicide.  

my psychiatrist had just changed my meds so i told myself, “give them a chance, maybe this time around things will be different.” the meds did help, a lot. however, i was also in a situation that was very unhealthy for my mental health.   

i took a HUGE leap into the unknown. i left my amazing husband after realizing i was gay and i started healing. i started my journey into health, independence, and self love. let me tell ya, it has been the hardest thing i’ve ever done.   

but!! i am happy! i haven’t hallucinated or had any delusions in months! i finally have hope. and i see a future for myself, let me tell ya, it is incredible!   

so if you are still reading this, i want you to know, it is possible. stability is possible. happiness is possible. hope is possible. it’s not an easy road to get there. but it IS possible.

Earlier today a woman on the bike trail looked back at me as if I were suspicious and didn't belong (this happens often). Another day a gentleman asked his wife if she was okay when I passed. These were real occurrences, not imagined. When things like this happen it just fuels the persecutory delusions.

I've been trying to talk more to my coworkers and get over my social anxiety, but I keep getting more and more anxious. The more I share with them (small opinions, little details about my day, pop culture things) the more I feel like whatever I say they're going to use against me somehow and cause me issues at my workplace. I'm scared they actually all hate me and want to cause me problems. It's probably all in my head, but I find myself hesitating to strike up a conversation because I feel threatened by this.

If this weren't a mental illness - if this were any other kind of illness - I wouldn't get judged for wanting to know more about it and how its affecting me. If I had cancer I'd damn well want to know everything pertinent about it.

It took years for me to figure out that others didn't talk about these things because it wasn't happening to them. 

I had been put on an anti-psychotic during a particularly bad manic episode. After that, I was pretty stable for several years.

Basically I cycle really fast. Ordinarily, I have hypomania for two weeks, mania for few days to weeks, depression anywhere from several days to half a year, and euthymia with psychosis for several weeks to about two months. But rarely I will experience mood swings that last hours, and one time they were minutes.

I told someone this, and they immediately told me that I do not actually have schizoaffective, which I was formally diagnosed with after extensive neurological testing, but instead that I have borderline PD, and that I wasn't ""truly"" mentally ill. This was right after I had been arrested the night before during a manic episode and was in a severe depression.

That experience has been extremely difficult to deal with. I have constant doubts over whether I'm really sick. But if I go off the meds, I become so mentally ill that I'm in and out of the emergency room almost weekly. I become incoherent, I experience repeated episodes of mania, I hallucinate and get delusions that are so complex and confusing that no one understands me, and I'm universally hated by everyone I talk to. And then there's the negative symptoms which are a total pain in the ass.

So that really fucked me up. I know what you're probably thinking, about me being weak and needing validation, and you're completely right. But just the knowledge that my type of rapid mood swinging is not a bipolar feature is deeply frightening. I don't know what it is. I don't know what I experienced. It makes it all the more real, all the ghosts and demons that tapped on my windows every night.

So to explain that without telling about my mental illness I have to basically lie and make stuff up (I've done it before and it is very tedious and usually unsuccessful).  

I am stable and on meds but my emotions are really dull and social situations make me anxious besides something routine like getting groceries. I've asked my psychologist I visit couple times a month how to deal with it and what he said was that I have to basically expose myself to these situations little by little until they no longer make me anxious. And also maybe ask some relative/friend for help.

I've been going through a lot lately and believed one night that I had to cut myself to atone for my sins. My sister came over thinking it would escalate to a suicide attempt and forced me to the hospital, where they admitted me to the psych ward. My experience was pretty rough. I went to the same hospital that my psychiatrist and therapist work at thinking I would get to see them but I never did. I was there for 6 days and only saw an actual doctor 3 times. Neither doctor had any idea what I was diagnosed with or why I was there in the first place, so I had basically five minutes to try to sum up everything for them. They more than doubled the number of medications I'm on and left it at that. Group therapy was once a day and not even every day. There were very few windows and only a clock at the nurse's station and the (locked) community room, so everyone was constantly disoriented on their schedule. It was difficult to get even basic necessities from the nurses like clothes and soap because they were so badly understaffed and burnt out. More than once I would see nurses verbally abuse patients in distress (even when nonviolent and just crying) and lock them in their rooms. There was another patient there who was clearly in psychosis who would scream and cry at all hours about her religious beliefs and that the nurses were trying to rape her. Both religion and rape are PTSD triggers of mine but there was no where I could go to to not hear her and I was completely ignored by the staff while I was panicking. In my panic I ended up clawing my legs to shreds with my fingernails and beating myself against the bathroom wall until I had bruises to cope. I still feel like I need to bleed to atone for my sins but I am really trying to fight the urge. The nurses also told me that I wasnt really I'll with my diagnoses, scolding me as if I had self diagnosed when two separate doctors gave me the same diagnoses? I got out only by pretending that the meds had made me all better and begging to go home, along with my family also trying from their end to get me out of there. I am no better than when I went in and in fact feel worse.

I just go out yesterday and I feel like I've been running for a long time and just stopped. I find myself hyperventilating a lot and unable to really stay calm. I'm really struggling to process everything and try to get back to any sense of normalcy. I am so terrified to ever go to a psych ward again.

You will never read this. So I can say whatever I need to. 

Having schizoaffective is hard. Every day I want to either overdose or not take my medication. But every day I see your face. I see you smile or cry when you wake up and I think, damn this is what its like to feel love. I thought I knew love. I thought I knew what it was like to be comfortable with someone. No. You are love. 

Love I have to protect. 

Even when I disconnect from you, I can't stop looking. Even when I break down, I think of you. I think of the last words I will say. I focus on being strong, on being on point, on focusing on something to keep me grounded in reality. Yeah, its exhausting. But I can do it. I can take the medication even if it will poison me. All for one more hour with you. I will put aside the delusions and rely on your father to keep me grounded. I will put aside my fears and anxieties to watch you grow. 

Yes, Mom is convinced she died and went to Heaven. But that doesn't mean I don't enjoy every second. 

No matter what happens, I love you. I love you to the moon and stars, to the universes beyond our own. I will not let anything bad happen. Thats why I don't follow my thoughts. I want to keep fighting for you. 

I always say don't live for anyone else. But I live for you every day. I live for your smiles, your cries, your tantrums and your laughs. Every day is memorable and I am glad I had you. I am glad the doctors were wrong. I am glad you have blessed me.",22,0

While many people are cognizant of the bipolar side (mood cycles including depressive states and mania), I found it is less common that people are aware of the schizophrenia aspects. First, I want to clear the misconception that people who have schizophrenia are **dangerous and a liability**. I have never harmed someone and have never thought about harming someone, nor have I ever been considered unsafe to others.

When it comes to my schizophrenic episodes, I have had delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations. While I can remember first having manic and depressive episodes as far back as 12 years ago, the delusions and hallucinations only began six years ago. I was a senior in college and constantly thought that whatever I read in my textbooks was directly written for me. I would quickly read literature novels and educational writings knowing that the author knew my life and the wrongdoings, and therefore was targeting me. Songs I heard on the radio didn’t simply depict my mood; the lyrics were also written about me and gave me secret messages of good and bad things to happen in my life. I never told anyone how anxious and paranoid I was feeling because I didn’t want to seem “crazy,” “out of my tree,” or like a “psychopath.” 

Quickly thereafter, I began to feel as though people were watching me every step I took. I imagined the police were following me and would arrest me at any point (I have never been pulled over for speeding) for being late to class or purchasing too much or too little food at the grocery store. I was positive someone was staking out where I lived and was going to kidnap me at any second. The stalking and kidnapping paranoia still continues off and on to this day.

The paranoia and delusions continued to rear its ugly self some years later, when I heard and saw old pickup trucks zooming back and forth past my house; I knew someone was going to come hurt my family and take me hostage. I was alone from time to time when this occurred, which resulted in me closing all the blinds in my house and turning on the alarm as soon as someone left, no matter the time of day. My anxiety also peaked at this time because I felt hopeless and scared, thinking I had no control over how my life was going.

It was three years ago that my auditory and visual hallucinations came to the forefront of my mental illness. I started hearing people whisper my name; I could even feel someone behind me, breathing down my neck. One night, I undoubtedly heard a baseball game playing on our television in the living room — someone had hit a home run — only to find out it was off. This was in the middle of January — clearly not baseball season. Other **auditory hallucinations** I experienced are people not only whispering my name but an unknown person yelling for me in another room or outside where I live. When I go to see who could possibly be crying out for me I find no one there, it leaves me shaken and disturbed.

I have seen a car drive directly towards me on the interstate where I have had to slam on my breaks and swerve. I have seen a bobcat about to run in front of me at a major intersection. Bugs and shadows will frequently slink on the walls and sneak around corners. A small dog has even run across my living room; I have never had the pleasure of having a dog for a pet.

One of the most significant hallucinations was three winters ago and my father just had hip replacement surgery. I had woken up one night drenched in sweat and extremely thirsty — this tends to happen quite frequently with my medicine — and walked to the kitchen. As I went, I noticed my dad was sleeping in the leather armchair and was snoring. I had to be extremely quiet as not to wake him. The next morning I asked him if I was too loud in the kitchen the previous night as he was asleep in the living room. He told me that he had slept in my parent’s bedroom the entire night for the first time since his surgery. Not only was I left confused, knowing what I had seen, but my dad was left extremely concerned.

[Hallucinations and delusions](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B3Y85JF), along with bipolar and anxiety, are tortuously woven together to create my life living with schizoaffective disorder. While I will never be “cured” of this illness, I have a great support team made up of family, friends and medical professionals to guide me through. I have gained extremely beneficial knowledge and coping skills to help diminish the effects of my disorder. However, the symptoms are sometimes too powerful for me to correct. If you have delusions and hallucinations, know you are not alone and they will pass, even if it seems time will always stand still. If you struggle or think that you might have a mental illness, always seek assistance. It can only go up from there.",12,0

I’m new to Reddit and looking for a community. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder almost a year ago now and am not sure about how I feel about the diagnosis. Even my psychiatrist said it’s not certain, but hasn’t updated it since. I had a major psychotic episode last June (lead to hospitalization) and a few minor ones since then. I also have mood disturbances such that I go through depressive and hypomanic episodes fairly regularly. The thing is, I am very high functioning and can hold down a job fine and am relatively social. I have friends, hobbies, and am feeling fine about where I am in life. I work with the homeless population and see schizophrenic/schizoaffective patients daily and I feel like I experience very little of what they go through. Is my diagnosis off? Or is this diagnosis a spectrum?

TL;DR: I don’t feel like I have severe enough symptoms to be schizoaffective even though I have a mood disorder with psychotic features",11,0

The original plan was to cut both my pinkies off with a circular saw, but the thought of how painful it would've been (I've cut off a finger before) kept me from doing it, so I slashed up my face and hand as mentioned before.

After calling the cops on myself and getting a free ride to the hospital in handcuffs, I was involuntarily committed. Forty days into my stay I went before a judge who decided I required treatment at the state mental hospital for a minimum of six months. I had pretty much resigned myself to my fate and realized I was looking at about a year-year and a half of institutionalization. 

By some miracle, in about a week leading up to a little over the 3 month mark in the psych ward, the plan the psychiatrist's had for me switched drastically.

The state petition was pulled and within a week I was shown the door. I have no idea what changed, but I do know I now have a huge incentive to stop seriourly mutilating my body. 100 days on the inside with nothing but more time ahead of you is no fun.",33,0
799,Tips for Schizoaffective that I've Found,30,ptgpgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/ptgpgf/tips_for_schizoaffective_that_ive_found/,23,1632346425.0,"1.) Antipsychotic medication is a must have, 100% of the time. If you never want to have an episode again, getting on the right AP is important and even though the side affects are sometimes unbearable, that just means you need to switch medicines, NOT get off of them altogether. 

2.) Take a SWAB TEST. This one is optional but it will save you ALOT of trial and error when it comes to medication. A pharmacogenetic test, if your insurance covers it or you can afford the steep price of getting one, WILL answer alot of your questions as to why some meds work better than others. Well worth it in my opinion and I think it should be one of the first things you do when diagnosed. 

3.) Scheduling is your FRIEND. If you have ever wondered why the healing process in Hospitals is so drastic, it's because when you're in there, you're on a SCHEDULE. Even without a strict schedule but keeping certain things around the same time like sleep and medicine intake, you can put your body on a rhythm and lay the foundation for a healthier and more positive lifestyle which means LESS SYMPTOMS. 

4.) Exercise for treating Bipolar symptoms is effective. If you have Schizoaffective bipolar subtype, this one's for you! Aside from being put on a higher dose of mood stabilizer, if your finding trouble falling asleep at night and melatonin is not working for you, try exercising at about 5pm. That way, you're tired enough when it comes to sleep time but not too amped up from the exercise that you can't sleep. Remember, long steady exercise that's preemptive will regulate your mood and keep you from having energy enough to start a bustle and rustle later. I recommend jogging, dancing, yoga, or biking.

5.) Diet is IMPORTANT! A gluten free, dairy free diet without excess sugary foods will benefit you INSTANTLY. Gluten will lower your energy levels, and send your mood out of whack while dairy and sugary foods you'll find will make symptoms worse... instantly. Being aware of these foods will make your days alot higher quality and eating the right foods will give you the clarity and energy needed to battle what symptoms you still have. Wondering what foods TO eat? Try this video: https://youtu.be/Iajhn_fPNE4 the whole list can be found in the description of the video. 

6.) Communication is KEY! Finding someone you can turn to for a reality check regularly is ideal, but what's more realistic is keeping a journal for you to go over with a therapist or someone who will NOT judge you, and may be able to deconstruct some of your delusions. 

7.) Cleansing helps PURIFY the heart. I for one have done some strange things while in psychosis, gotten into some strange concepts spiritually, and I realized that I must recognize that WHAT I DID WRONG AFFECTS ME. My soul, my spirit, and in turn, my mind. If you are the type of person to believe in these types of things, I believe it would benefit you greatly as did I to work on finding your spiritual path, do some soul searching and cleanse yourself by whatever means you're comfortable with to rid yourself of any wrongdoings or odd spiritual commitments made when you were not of right mind. 

8.) Remember YOU HAVE Schizoaffective. The hardest part for me so far in my journey of the things I've actually completed in this list was accepting the fact that I have this disorder. Being diagnosed a chronic illness isn't easy for anyone to accept but I never began to heal as rapidly as I am now until I found someone who accepted me for who I am, and with them I came to the conclusion that I AM schizoaffective. Remembering this simple fact helps me when I'm experiencing symptoms like delusions or paranoia because it reminds me that, these are just symptoms of an illness that I have, and I can understand that now, and not think too far into it, because I know it can be tough getting out of that stage that we reach. It could have been the stigma that kept me from accepting myself and constantly having identity issues and to anyone who is suffering to break through the stigma and accept you for you I have this to say: you are a beautiful human being, and everything real that makes you who you are, 
is perfect.

I was very much suicidal a few months ago, and even a little while ago. I thought that by maybe holding out a little bit more, that it would get better. Oh boy, how wrong I was. Not only have things not improved, in some ways they've gotten worse for me.

I recently got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, on top of the major depressive disorder that comes with it, the anxiety, and severe cptsd. On top of all of that, I am currently in college, and I feel as though my brain is literally declining, and that my mental faculties aren't what they used to be. I am tempted to drop a few courses or to even drop this semester entirely.

What the heck man. I hold out for hope and this is what is given to me. You might think I am insanely sad typing all of this, but I can't help but laugh at how much of a joke my life has been. 23 years of abuse, pain, and suffering, all just to cultivate to this moment. A crazy schizophrenic and depressed man who nobody likes for some reason. Again, I just laugh while typing that out. Do you know what the more crazy part is? I'm already on medication and I am seeing a therapist now. Yet nothing changes. Neither will give me a good past, or take away my mental health problems, or give me a guaranteed good future.

Now comes the main point of the post. Is my life over, is it worth continuing? I don't really live for my family and friends, since both groups don't really exist for me. Everyone has treated me badly, so I figure why would anyone suddenly miss me if I'm gone. Maybe this post won't ever get read, and maybe I'll be dead soon. Or still alive in a straitjacket. Either way, I'm gonna head off now to class, and stare off into space as the teacher speaks over the zoom app.",11,0

5 years ago I flunked out of college for the first time. I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I made an attempt on my life, the first of 3. Was once again admitted to a hospital.

3 years ago I failed out of another college, another attempt was made, another hospital trip. There, I finally got the diagnosis of schizoaffective. I was put on antidepressants and antipsychotics and I started feeling a little better.

2 years ago, me and my psychiatrist finally found the right medications. Cymbalta and Abilify. My hallucinations were minimal, and my depression subsided over time. I found a good job that I still work to this day.

3 months ago, I made my final suicide attempt. I failed (obviously). It was a wake up call for me. I had stopped going to therapy and was not being consistent with my meds. I was also working from home and rarely left the house. I realized that self care isn’t always easy, but was ultimately was worth it.

Today, I am eating healthy, working out, have several hobbies, and am returning to the office so I have an excuse to clean myself up and leave the house everyday.

I'm not a doctor, but from everything uploaded into my mind- I feel like everything the brain does is a protective measure, even delusions. What exactly did I need protecting from? What is my brain blocking me from seeing? What is it not capable of processing?

My husband was just recently diagnosed with bipolar Schizoaffective disorder.. we were moving into our new apartment this past weekend and he woke up a completely different person. He ended up driving our U-Haul filled with our belongings and claimed that a deacon told him to give away all of our belongings. I’m currently 35 weeks pregnant, and this sudden event has just completely destroyed me.

He’s currently still in the hospital, where they originally diagnosed him with bipolar type one with psychosis. He wasn’t making much sense the first few days, his sentences were all over the place and he has an obsession with reading the Bible… but my husband hates organized religion. He believes he’s a prophet and says he loves everyone and wants to be celibate. The doctors and nurses are telling me he’s not himself yet, even though he’s sounding more normal over the phone.

This is his first ever episode, and I don’t know what to do or think. Is this way of thinking permanent? Will he always think he’s a prophet and have a hard time trusting? Or is this the way episodes usually go? If there is such a thing as waking up from this, will he remember it at all?

You are not making this up. You are, in fact, actually mentally ill. And there is no shame in taking steps to protect your mental health. If you'd kept your job, you likely would have had a major breakdown. If you didn't feel like you could keep it, then that is the direction you were heading. You could either take a break and work on yourself, or you could have a serious mental break that would see you stuck in a hospital for a while. Everyone here just does what they can. You are doing what you can. You are not alright, so don't let yourself convince yourself that you're faking. With that mentality, if you were faking, then you would be able to simply stop. Can you stop faking? No? Then you are not faking.

We met in a mental hospital a few years ago and have had the most loving relationship full of bliss. However, he was left paralyzed with countless other health issues literally bed bound in a nursing home where he remains to this day after a super severe suicide attempt 1.5 years ago.

 I've never doubted our relationship or our love or what we share through all of this. I have been positive that this is what I want for my life if it means to be with him and make his life better. We have had endless serious conversations about going overseas for treatment together, I have started saving money for our future place together when his health allows, and we have even started the process of filing for me to become his care giver and I even agreed I would quit my career to make this possible. A lot to take on, but I was willing and fearlessly ready to take all of this on just to be by his side....untill...

Enter his aunt 2 weeks ago who destroyed his parents relationship years ago and, has been hated by the family since,by having an incestual relationship with his dad. Long story short she wants the dad's money so she wants to take care of my boyfriend in hopes of his dad buying them a place and her having a retirement plan. My boyfriend is okay with her using him because he says he's using her too and he's also unknowingly in the middle of one of his schizoaffective episodes he gets.  

For the past two weeks I have heard nothing but how much his aunt has done for him (over the last 2 weeks only obviously) , how she visits more than I do (she doesn't work I do and Ive been visiting regularly the past 1.5 years where as she JUST came into the picture smh), how he's going to move into her place (and I wouldn't be allowed to even stay the night), how he's going to buy her a flight so he can go overseas with her, how she's going to be his care taker, even telling me how much worse her mental illness is than mine (super invalidating and ironic because I don't tell him my real problems to protect his vulnerable state). Oh and how his aunt would fuck him too if his dick worked. I'm holding on for our future together since we don't have much now, but where do I fit into this new future? 

The main problem I have is for at least the past week he has showed NO interest in me or my life. I'm just someone to talk AT about his aunt. He does not ask about my day how I'm doing how was work or anything I have going on in life. Anything I share he asks no follow up questions. I feel unseen. Unheard. Not understood. I understand he is very sick but if he's capable to talk at me about his aunt for hours he's capable of asking about my day.

At first I was thinking I should be okay with all this because I want him out of the nursing home too for him. Not me. But I don't see if he's allowed to live with his aunt why he wouldn't just get a place with me? I asked him about it and he flipped out telling me I'm making him choose between me and his aunt and how it's making him say fuck you to me and go closer to his aunt. He yelled at me so I left and we haven't reached out to each other since.

Im not the only one offput by his aunt or his recent behavior. His mother and other family members stopped talking to him too since he reunited with her as it has been the ultimate betrayal. Ive seen him go through episodes before but he's especially hostile this time around.  

So what are my options? What would you do? I'm in so far deep in this fucked up situation I can't even see it clearly. I don't WANT to leave him. All I want to do is nurture him. I can handle the paralysis. I can handle the health problems. I can handle his deteriorating mental health. What I can't handle is him rewriting our plans and future with another woman and counting me out . What I can't handle is him not being curious about my fucking day. But honestly can anyone shed some insight into his recent behavior in the context of schizoaffective disorder?",13,0
