If you were half the good person you wish you were you’d give yourself acute lead poisoning via smith n Wesson. The fact that you don’t proves you’re a piece of shit.”

* If I stay away, it’s because I don’t want to cause you any more pain, or make you feel like I’m bullshitting you. I’ve never lied about wanting to change my situation, wanting a job, wanting to do all the things I need to be doing or want to be doing; when I say I’m going to do something, I truly believe I will do it. Whatever explanation follows on why I didn’t do it are completely irrelevant...and unknown 

* I am not proud of myself and this is not the life that I want

* I am not on drugs all the time; I smoke weed sometimes and do the occasional bump when out, but I hate snorting stuff haha point is, drugs would be an explanation for my current loser in life status but removing them wouldn’t weigh heavy on my life. Kinda wish they did...then I could just stop doing them and be “cured” 

* ^Do not whatsoever blame them for thinking I am. I act nuts. 

* I don’t know where to go from here, and I realize fully that I have no more chances with my loved ones

* I’m not sure how to proceed in my relationships with my parents; do you want me to be here right now? Or no? I am not being sarcastic! I will respect whatever it is, I just don’t know if my presence is unwanted or hurtful because I. Can’t. Read. Situations apparently 

* I wish they didn’t give me so much credit for somehow masterminding everything, especially how to get out of working for going on almost a year…this isn’t because I’ve figured out how to cheat the system and use people haha…the truth is I have no motherfucking clue why I am where I am.  That’s not to say I don’t take responsibility for why I am where I am - but yeah, beyond knowing I am where I am, I know basically nothing

* I sort of wish they knew how frequently I think about killing myself…then again, I hope no one ever knows that.  I wish they could know how little I care about living or dying, how often my body screams red flags to me and I not only ignore them, but they sort of turn me on; as in, I wonder how this will go…I trust any and every outcome is for the best

* I wish they knew I knew how shitty a person I feel I am. I wish they knew that every negative feeling they have re me is a blip on the radar compared to how maximized those negative feelings are in me

* I wish they knew how desperately I needed them

* I wish they knew how afraid I am of getting a job, I’m terrified about it going south...and this will inevitably paralyze me - both in finding a job and being a job, which will ultimately lead to losing one. 

* I wish these INTENSE feelings of feeling so misunderstood and alone that you want to love everyone you meet so fiercely to make sure no one else feels the same way on no one. I feel delusional. It feels like I’m in an English speaking society speaking my own made up language, all of us wondering why we can’t understand each other.

12,"""High functioning"" BPD",12,8obp0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/8obp0g/high_functioning_bpd/,10,1528059926.0,"Hey everyone :) My 1st time posting here, or anywhere for that matter with this question. I am 30 years old and I believe that I may have BPD. Due to my country of residence and several other factors, I never got the diagnose, even though I was shortly hospitalized at the age of 17 for self harm and suicide threats/one attempt. Besides that, on the inside I identify with several other BPD diagnostic criteria (fluctuating self-image, feeling of emptiness, mood swings, anger, splitting...), but there are also several ways in which I feel like I differ in behavior. I would like to describe my patterns a bit and get opinions from people who are diagnosed with this PD, is there anyone out there who can relate to my ways of coping with these kind of feelings?

I think it's best described on the aspect of personal relationships.
I keep people on a distance, not letting them get too close by rarely sharing how I feel deep down, which is helping me maintain relatively stable and long-term, not too intense relationships. Whenever I perceive something as an insult or a threat, get jealous, on the inside I get terrified I will be abandoned, but on the outside I withdraw from the person, act aloof and let the ball be in their court. Usually I over-react over something minor in my head, have an episode of feeling like I'm losing the person in question and feeling sad about it, struggling with that on my own while at the same time withdrawing from them, which tends to provoke them to reach out 1st, which then reassures me and makes me realize it was an overreaction in the 1st place.
Furthest I came to opening up in that regard was jokingly admitting I'm jealous. I tend to sound sarcastic when talking about feelings, and would consider it a weakness to show anyone they can make me upset and to which extent. The only emotion I freely express is anger, and I do have a reputation of someone who has a temper thanks to that. I tend to get into arguments with whoever ""disrespects"" me - or better to say in psychological terms, triggers anything inside me that I perceive as not being valued as a human being.
There are a few interactions with kids/now young adults in my life, where I am being mentor-like, in which I feel as if I am excluding the ego-part of myself. I just give unselfishly with the desire to help the young person grow and have the kind of support I wish I had. Those kind of interactions make me feel ""normal"", in sense that no matter how I feel on the inside I muster strength to act supportive and functional as ""my kids"" are used to and expect of me. I had a really great uncle growing up and I try to act in a way he did towards me.
When it comes to romantic relationships, whenever I was involved with someone the fear of abandonment would intensify during that interaction to the point of making me mildly crazy, it was something I have to force myself to stop thinking about, and there's always a constant struggle inside me, trying to ignore the voice saying ""I should end this right away not to let him abandon and hurt me"". Being the one to end things 1st was more important to me as younger, lately I tend to avoid romantic interactions altogether but I do think I would be more mature about getting rejected and it's not a priority to avoid it.
I had a few closer friendships that came to an end, one of those with a friend who I even started opening up to to a greater extent than to anyone else, it felt like being abandoned by someone because they got to know me better. The feeling sucked, but the feeling of surviving it made me feel on one hand more miserable overall, but on the other hand more confident I can handle rejection and abandonment better than ever before.

In all other life aspects, I also feel like doing what all my instincts usually tell me to do may make me ""lose control"" and I tend to inhibit all of the behaviors I feel the need to do (eg. general impulsiveness).
Prior to hospitalization I was cutting, drinking, engaging in casual sex and some other risky behaviors, and it was as if I was ""acting out"" to get attention and help - once hospitalized, I kind of subconsciously realized that my ways, and the kind of ""help"" the world has to offer to me, was being stigmatized and even locked up against my own will, so ever since I got out I became fighter-like, stopping to complain or expect sympathy, getting as independent as possible, freely expressing anger to whoever angers me etc. As if I was feeling hateful and angry towards myself to the point of wanting to kill myself, and then I felt injured to the point I started feeling rage towards those who were affecting my life negatively, particularly my parents. I spent over an year not talking to them, and that time helped me heal from all that a great deal, and start to behave functionally. The wounds are definitely still there but I made my life as healthy as possible, if you look at it on the outside. I maintain an image of someone who chooses to be ""different"", eg ideologically not wanting to get married or work on a permanent job in a capitalist system, which is something I do agree with in theory, but also there's the secret aspect of feeling unlovable once someone gets to know me, unfit to be a parent as I didn't have good parent-models and looming fear I couldn't love my child unconditionally, being unable to hold a job as I start feeling like I will reveal too much of my personality in a work environment and stressing out due to that, plus generally fluctuating how I feel about myself on day-to-day basis, etc.
I think I have never felt as bad as I do in the past several months, and still I am managing to maintain the appearance of a moderately healthy person. A part of me fears I will start to feel as if my ""public persona"" is so much different from what I actually am, that I won't have the strength to maintain it anymore.

TLDR version: Are there people on here with BPD diagnose who tend to completely hide their feelings from people, and if there are, how does that work for you and make you feel? Thanks in advance :)",12,0

It’s like they’re not even mine.

They control me. Overwhelm me.

They crush me into the ground.

I’m never just happy,

I’m never just sad,

It’s either the best day of my life,

I’m devastated or I’m uncontrollably mad.

 

I will push you away,

Then I’ll beg you not to leave me.

I’ll scream at you. I’ll hurt you.

Then say I’m nothing without you.

I’ll hide how I’m feeling,

Tell you that everything is fine,

I’ll build a wall around my heart,

So it won’t break when you’re gone.

 

I don’t look in the mirror,

When I do I don’t see me.

That person is angry. They’re mean.

They just scream that I’m crazy.

I can’t ignore them,

I can’t walk away,

Their words engraved in my mind,

I can hear them every day.

 

The days that are the worst,

Are the days that I spiral.

I can’t hide. I can’t breathe.

I’m just screaming and falling.

I don’t have a life boat,

I’ve no hope to hold on to,

Everything just overwhelms me,

I just feel like I’m drowning.

 

When my world starts to shrink,

The pain starts to smother me.

I can’t scream. I can’t fight.

Inside I feel empty.

My mind starts to wander,

And my heart feels broken,

I just want my life back,

But these words are left unspoken.

 

I try to keep fighting,

But some days it’s too hard.

I’ll cry. Then I’ll sleep.

Everything is better in dreamland.

I will hide in my room,

I won’t eat for days,

I’ll pretend everything is fine,

I’ll stay this world until I’m no longer lying.

 

My days become nights,

I don’t let people see me.

I stop eating. I stop sleeping.

I stop caring about breathing.

I’ll tell myself I’m fine,

I’ll play music to try feel things,

I will believe my own lie,

Forget rock bottom is where I’m living.

 

I never want to give up,

But I just start to fade.

I’m lost. I’m scared.

I feel like I’m disappearing.

I don’t feel real,

I don’t know who I am,

My emotions are too strong,

I already feel like a ghost.

 

I try push through the fog,

It makes me feel like I’m drowning.

The fear. The emptiness.

It always surrounds me.

I know there’s a light,

I try to have hope,

I remember to smile,

I think of those I love most.

 

That’s when it happens,

That’s when the weight lifts.

Not completely. Not much.

But enough for me to see.

I push and reach out,

I find the word I need most,

I scream, and I shout,

Then you find me in the smoke.

I've been in therapy for 7 years but when I heard the diagnosis, everything made sense.

I'm truly not in a great state and I haven't been for years. My health makes employment very difficult. My abuser (my dad) who had a huge part creating my trauma died a last month. He was abusive to the end. My ex broke up with me 6 months ago and what destroyed us was my mental illness.  I'm in a lot of pain right now. I just want my life to move forward and improve. I don't want to live in the past like I have been for the last 6 years, I don't want to hurt myself because I don't deserve all the self hate I feel.

I'm just trying to not feel bad and to move on with my life.

One big change I want to make  I want to be employed.  i'm 25, and I've never have been able to keep a job for a month because my anxiety is very strong along with being very deeply damaged by my abuser. I'm very behind in life and I feel so much shame. I have unrealistic ideas about societal pressure and I need to stay calm. I can barely get through employment programs without feeling emotional.

I also want to add even with exercise and medication, I have poor sleep. I often can go two nights a week with no sleep because of rumination. The stress I feel thinking all night often consistently makes me exhausted, and drained. I'm often sleep deprived. I can't stand the fact that I've been struggling with employment for so long. because of my health and poor attitude.

I was employed for a day as a cashier but I was very discouraged;  I felt so much guilt about how slow I was on cash register. I messed up and I made the company lose money. My boyfriend at the time expressed how my anxiety felt unprofessional. My boss told him he felt like I was going to cry at any moment. I felt bad my best wasn't up to par. After that experience I left. That was about a year ago. I am so demoralized how I'm going to get a job with my sleeping issues and self esteem issues.

when I was younger my dad would paint the world as unforgiving and tell me I was useless unless I overachieved, and now I feel horrible and anxious in new situations to torturous degrees.  I beat myself up over how stupid I feel and how nervous. I feel my life hasn't moved forward in years. I know though this is a stepping stone I need to get over to actually be employed long term though.

I sent my resume to a few places and I want to try again but I'm trying to let go of the shame I felt. I want to go in with positive feelings. I've done a lot of volunteer work but every time I go in I just feel so useless like i'm not contributing to anything meaningful. I want to be a valuable worker.

Can't anyone give me tips on how to cope with these thoughts i'm feeling? I see my illness as another reason why I can't get employed but I know some part of me is capable of employment despite my challenges. This was really hard to write because it's a vulnerable topic for me and I'm sure not everyone is going to understand, but this is where i'm at in my life and it's been this way for so long. I want to break free.

I wanted to add, two months ago I had a wonderful experience at a print shop. I made it to 4 out of 5 days a week, which seems horrible but considering my health  It's huge. I was happy where I worked. Unfortunately during the last two weeks of the program I spent 3 days awake with no sleep except for 2 hours and started hallucinating. no nights of sleep are very common for me, but not hallucination. I had to stop the program for my health. I want to try it again once my health is better and my boss said he'd be happy to have me. He strongly believes I can get into the graphic design industry which made me feel amazing, but I want to beat the feelings I get before I try the program again.

27,I am crazy - A warning letter to anyone considering entering a relationship with a borderline,53,939l8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/939l8e/i_am_crazy_a_warning_letter_to_anyone_considering/,24,1532996271.0,"I will preface this by saying that there is no doubt I have BPD. I am a textbook case. I do not have an official diagnosis because I fear that labeling it will make me less motivated to change, so I have asked the mental health professionals I have been working with to treat me as if I am BPD but to refrain from diagnosis or even mentioning the name to me.

For as long as I can remember, I have been a manipulative person. I have always sensed that there was something deeply wrong with me and the way I interacted with the world around me. My familial relationships have all been destroyed by my poor decisions, and my dating life is characterized by a long line of toxic relationships starting from the time I was 14. I have very few friends, and none that I interact with on a daily basis. I am incapable of maintaining these relationships.

I am psychotic in the most basic sense of the word. I create scenarios in my mind that have no connection to reality, and am unable to disconnect these fabricated scenarios from the real world. I act entirely on my emotions. I ignore any facts or evidence that my be presented to me. This causes me to behave in a way that can only be described as gaslighting. I do not do this intentionally, nor do I act with any malicious intent, but it happens nonetheless.

I am unbelievably insecure. Every time I get the sense that someone doesn't want to be around me, I have an extreme emotional reaction that is completely inappropriate for the situation at hand. I need constant affection and reassurance, and I am incapable of understanding why my SO needs time alone or other friends besides me. This effectively isolates my SO from friends and family, making it harder for them to leave me.

I have extreme mood swings depending on the current situation. I feel every emotion more strongly than my non-BPD counterparts. I don't feel sad, I fall into a deep depression. I don't feel angry, I seethe with rage. I don't feel happy, I feel elated. My emotions cause me to act in very extreme ways. My highs are higher than imaginable, and my lows are the lowest. My mood swings can be confusing to my SO and may seem manipulative. Again, this is not my intention.

Fighting with me will accomplish nothing. In an argument with a borderline, both parties lose. This is because of all the subconscious manipulation tactics I employ. Again, none of this is intentional. These behaviors are caused by my extreme emotions, and my deeply flawed worldview. In short, if someone says or does something that conflicts with the fantasy world my mind created, I assume the worst. I assume they must be lying or that they must hate me.

I have been in recovery. At one point in my life I realized how wrong my behaviors were. I cannot control my emotions, but I do not have to let them control me. I have been in an emotionally stable state where I was able to react appropriately to events in my life. I know that recovery is possible. I suffered through the grief of losing three people that were very close to me in a short time, and slipped back into all of my old habits and my flawed worldview. The BPD will always be there, but that is no reason to allow it to control my life.",53,0

My major problem is pain. I've read in ""Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder: How to Keep Out-of-Control Emotions from Destroying Your Relationship"" 1st Edition 

by 	                                                       	         	     	  		 		 			  [Shari Y. Manning](https://www.amazon.com/Shari-Y.-Manning/e/B004R8B8WA/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)(Author),

that bpd people have very strong emotions. Very strong emotions lead to pain in many ways, for example, you're in a situation that would annoy anyone, but since you have bpd the annoyance is much stronger, and the emotions turn into negative thoughts, that re-trigger more neg emotions that re-trigger neg thoughts, and round and round it goes until the negative thoughts and emotions generalize to other things and so I spend much time being in a lot of pain because negative emotions and thoughts. Though this cycle does stop sometimes, they can come back easily, so I experience strong, chronic pain daily if not all day or for longer periods. From there I understand the behavior that this room is so full of. If someone is dealing with chronic, high levels of pain, they can't be nice a lot of the time, or are way more sensitive to neg comments or situations. They can't think of how others are feeling when overwhelmed with their own feelings coming from overwhelming pain. Isn't it obvious that if a person is in a lot of pain for a long time, but they ""look normal' (like you can't see that someone is suffering from pain at the level of terminal cancer) but if you (the non-bpd person) doesn't know about it, you can't understand it when they snap or are out of sorts. So for me having bpd is about dealing with a high level of pain when no one around me knows it and expects me to act as if I weren't since the non-bpd person doesn't know how much pain is affecting our interaction, so expects much more reasonable and considerate behavior, which I can't give SOMETIMES, because I'm busy dealing with not screaming because I hurt so much. From there, most of the symptoms used to describe bpd stem.  I think people can't tell because long ago (I mean in our cribs as babes, reinforced as we moved into the world) bpd people have been trained by negative social responses that if we don't control our expressions of pain, down to the look on our faces, we were outcast immediately. People could not deal with seeing that much pain so often, so by leaving us or complaining about it or whatever, showing displeasure in some way, they taught us that we shouldn't show the level of pain we're dealing with, and not show people how hard we're working to not show it, so they can feel comfortable enough to stand being around us. After all, who wants to be with someone who is in constant agony? It must make people feel awkward, or like, ""what to do?"" or guilty? (that they can't help and are dealing with someone in such agony who is having to work really hard just to be  accepted as someone who can hang around if it isn't too long. I'm floored by seeing so many people in relationships. I know my pain makes people feel ""uncomfortable = not happy"" being around someone they know is in agony and could, at any time be overwhelmed, and ""go off"". How unpleasant is that? I can't believe anyone would even consider spending their life with a person who has bpd,  so is in constant agony, and who can't help but ""go off"" at least sometimes, be inconsiderate at least sometimes, be afraid of abandonment (its happened so often, and under circumstances where the basic reasons for what happened weren't understood - pain became too much and / or the unpleasantness of being with someone in such constant pain became too much.) What kind of pain is it? both very strong and chronic pain in the psyche and body, yet the medications they try on us are never for dealing with pain - only symptoms are treated. Why not try stopping the pain? Is this just a problem for me?  I would like to know if other people with bpd, when they think about it, think that intense, unending emotional pain is the basic problem, and that the rest follows. How many of you are in pain?  If the pain went away, would you be able to act like people expect and feel comfortable with? ",33,0

My issues stem from my childhood- I am a product of narcissistic parenting. My whole life I was afraid of going out by myself; even the most mundane task of running out to the store to buy salt scared me. I was sheltered in the most unhealthiest manner and commuting to and from school terrified me when I did it the first time. Then I started going to further distances- I would cross different cities and provinces without the knowledge of my parent.  This reflected in my decision-making and relationships, platonic or romantic. A small setback would make me not want to go out and see people. Whenever a romantic partner would look away as I converse with them, I took it as a sign of rejection. I would get anxious whenever arguments would arise and feel unloved when misunderstandings happened. I always go through one fixation to another- be it unrequited love, a committed relationship, companionship or purely casual.  

When my therapist sat down with me and finally concluded my diagnosis, it was like the gates of heaven slamming me back to earth. Terrifying yet humanizing. I try my best everyday to read about BPD and how to manage but I would like to interact with people with the same condition as mine.

36,I may have inadvertantly ruined my marriage without knowing it,16,99ion5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/99ion5/i_may_have_inadvertantly_ruined_my_marriage/,2,1534983938.0,"I have been lurking a lot over in the r/Divorce subreddit for the past 8 months since my wife left me (39M) with the kids. Things had been rocky with us for probably the better part of 21 years. I have only as of the past week realized that I may actually have in fact  been largely responsible for the separation (and possible eventual divorce) because I have either a personality or mood disorder, or possibly both. I have always felt like my reactions to things are at times a little over the top and I definitely identify with almost all of the criteria outlined in the DSM-5 for BDP. Looking back I think I have just been in denial that there was even anything wrong at all and that it was my wife who was the one causing the conflict in our relationship. News flash, it wasn't. 

Shortly after she had moved out with the kids I immediately went into a defensive mode in effort to protect my rights to shared custody of my kids which I felt at the time was more important than anything else. What I failed to acknowledge at the time (and my lawyer even warned me about) was the possibility of destroying what little was left between my wife and I. According to her calling the police and getting a lawyer involved was what put things to an end for her. I honestly felt at the time I was doing the right thing. I now realize I had likely changed the narrative of what went down before her eventually leaving me. And I believed it. 

We recently had a long phone conversation and she explained to me what really happened. She left because she was afraid of me because of how angry I was becoming and she felt I was unstable and a threat to herself and the kids and myself. She was only trying to protect herself and the kids from me. But I couldn't see it at the time as to why she would feel it was necessary to do so..because I was in compete denial there was even anything wrong with me. 

But I now realize that I have been having the same conflict in my life even with her not around. I still wake up some days ok and some days not at all. It has become apparent that the conflict is within me alone and not a result of any external factors. I realize now why she left me, because of who I had allowed myself to become.

I made a call to my local mental health services administration today and they pulled my records from the pscyhiatric clinic I voluntarily checked myself into the year prior, but had decided not to return to and commit to the therapy they had me scheduled for. Now that I am ready to accept this has been something out of my control for the past 8 months even after she left (and possibly my entire adult life), I am ready to go back and share everything that I possibly can with them in effort to get a proper diagnosis and start the healing process. I can only hope that it isn't too little too late to still save my marriage but on the same hand I feel she may be actually better off without me now. ",16,0

Growing up I was a kid who always ""cried easily"" and basically cried at the drop of a hat, even at the smallest things, even at things or events that would seem random but would nevertheless bring this gigantic flood of emotion tied to it. As expected, the older I got the less ""socially acceptable"" or ""empathy inducing"" ( I don't know if this is the right way to say it exactly) the tears became to others. It was no longer ""cute"" as a former friend of mine told me. At a certain age, other people understandably begin to look at hysterical tears in an ""functional appearing adult"" as and write it off as ""pathetic"" to ""manipulative"" and all else in between. And BPD certainly has taken me down those roads, for sure, but the pain behind the tears is REAL, the pain behind those completely irrational thoughts and feelings is VERY REAL despite how out of context they may be. 

As an adult over time I learned strategies as simple as getting out of a room very quickly (""emergency bathroom break""), immediately terminating a conversation etc, as soon as I felt a real outburst come on. I learned to ways to calm myself own and talk myself out of it, I learned how to let myself  ""cry it out"" as much as I needed in private, I learned meditation, I learned how to ""write through my feelings"",and had an excellent therapist who would allow me a catharsis in session and hold space for me in an empathetic way. 

Despite all of these good coping skills, I recently ended up leaving my job because I was not able to put these skills effectively into use and my ability to remain professional at the workplace ultimately suffered. Immediately after I was hired I found myself in an FP situation with my direct supervisor and spent the majority of my year brown nosing up to him, as well as over extending myself in every way imaginable to try to impress him, which included making promises on things I simply did not have the ability to accomplish (talk about magical thinking). He was supportive of me throughout the majority of my time working with him, but over the course of the year I can see how he lost patience with me due to my complete reliance on his approval in every way. 

The first time I cried in front of him as a result of just being over stressed due to the demands of the job, he was sympathetic and non-shaming, but as the year went on and the burnout increased I can see now how his opinion changed of me ""because I couldn't live up to doing all those things I said I would do"". Feedback which needed to be direct / blunt of course felt like an knife wound and towards the end I would fall apart in front of him on multiple occasions because I could not take criticism at all...mostly because it was coming from him, as my FP. The change from being his most reliable subordinate to the ""problem"" in the office just reinforced my complete inability to remain professional. I couldnt stop crying these trigger tears. An eye roll? An off hand sarcastic comment in one of our team meetings directed at me (or felt to be)? Coming in to talk to him about something and him scrolling through his phone reading emails in the middle of me talking?  I fell apart. I fell apart and then his boss came to give me the classic ""your skills could be put to better use elsewhere in this company speech"" aka-here is the writing on the wall, get out now before we force you out or you fuck up further. I feel like shit. The shame of the way I acted, his inability to understand really, the complete lack of closure, the loss of the opportunity another year wasted and I've done this SO many times and I feel like I never learn.

The last two days I just haven’t wanted to do a thing (which is slightly less than I was doing before) I know I’m probably focusing on the negatives too much... but I’m just overwhelmed, devastated. .",10,0
59,Feeling like a Fake,27,9mleva,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/9mleva/feeling_like_a_fake/,9,1539052899.0,"When my psychiatrist first suggested I may be borderline, I was shocked. I only ever had been diagnosed with major depressive, and I assumed all the other symptoms came from that. But this psychiatrist went much more in depth with me in having me explain all my symptoms, and that was how she drew the BPD conclusion. I then found a book called BPD Demystified, and reading just the first few chapters brought tears to my eyes. It was like coming home; suddenly it was like everything made sense. I wasn't/am not just depressed. There's a reason why I can't seem to control my emotions, which I only ever feel at 0 or 100. There's a reason why I see so many things in black or white, why I'm terrified that everyone hates me and will eventually leave. There's a reason why I can cycle through 10 different emotions in a matter of minutes, and a reason for having intense episodes of derealization. There's a reason for all the intense anger I feel so often, even if I have managed to restrain myself from exploding.

But despite all that making sense. Despite my psychiatrist telling me I have BPD, I find myself not believing it sometimes. Right now I'm sitting here thinking; no, that can't be it. It can't be that this disorder that perfectly describes what I've been feeling for years could be the answer. Obviously I'm just a bad person. Obviously there is something wrong with me and I'm doing this all on purpose because I'm a bad person. Because I don't want to try hard enough to be happy.

And I do the same with my disordered eating habits. Even though I've fasted for days, restricted for months, or purposely binged and purged, weighed myself excessively or exercised till I was dizzy. I see that I'm not as bad as others are, so it must not be a problem. I'm just lazy, or looking for attention.

60,Hope for BPD,11,9mp627,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/9mp627/hope_for_bpd/,3,1539091922.0,"I was diagnosed in my early 30's due to psychotic episodes that landed me in the hospital. I'm 40 now and have actively participated in DBT, CBT, counselling (both group and individual), and have been under the care of a psychiatrist. Recently, my psychiatrist and counselor have stated that I'm well enough to stop seeing them regularly and I agree. It's been a tough road but I feel my BPD has calmed down with time and therapy. I just wanted to say the therapy helps and there is hope. 

I feel more like me now that I'm not so angry and empty. I've grown so much through therapy. The individual therapy was helpful to discuss the things that I never had the courage to face before. Group therapy was helpful to me cause I realized I wasnt alone or even the worst case out there. DBT helped me refocus my thought processes...the most important thing I learned was to name my feelings and sit with them. Slowly my emotions stopped controlling my actions. I feel more grown up and in charge of me now.

It took time...10 years...for the ppl around me to see the changes and accept the new me. I guess with all the damage I did to my relationships, only time and new memories could heal the wounds. I changed so eventually those around me did too. I'm happier now. 

I still get lonely and feel empty from time to time but I get the feels will pass; where as before, they felt like the end of the world. I still get upset but I'm less destructive now. 

I've learned empathy and this has been so helpful. Putting myself in others shoes before I rip them a new one has changed things drastically. I find when I see things from other views the greys become clearer and easier to identify. The world looks less black and white now.

Anyhow...I hope you all good luck!",11,0

My new gf is exhibiting some behavior that alarms me. I’m discovering she is extremely needy when it comes to physical attention. First some alarms went off when she started pressuring me into sex. If we hang out one night without sex she thinks something is wrong and becomes insecure.  She told me that verbatim. This all came out the one night we didn’t have sex as I could sense her dissatisfaction. It hasn’t really been a huge problem since we do have sex every night, but I honestly have never run into this problem. But last night was weird. 

When we are asleep at night she is constantly trying to spoon me. She smashes her body up against me to the point where I’m on the edge of the bed about to fall off and I have seriously like a foot of room. I consistently in the nicest way possible tell her I need some room. Sometimes several times a night. Last night I just got up and she asked me what was wrong. I told her in the nicest way possible I’m a restless sleeper and I can’t sleep in such a restrictive position. This did not go over well. She pretty much twisted my words and made me out to be a bad guy telling me it was “bad timing.” She repeated back to me “oh so I’ve just been making you miserable every night.” I was a little loss for words and tried to explain myself further but it seemed to fall on deaf ears. She told me she doesn’t know if she can be with someone who doesn’t cuddle her all night. I went to smoke some cannabis (my sleep aid) and she literally told me I wasn’t allowed. I told her that she’s making me feel like my most basic need (sleep) as a human being feel challenged and that she’s sending my signals that I don’t have basic autonomy as a person. I made an analogy that guilt tripping me for my sleep needs is like guilting someone for needing water. I tried to articulate myself the best I could and she mostly just layed there in silence with her back turned. She said “I’m being a fucker” so I put my work clothes on and left. Trying to talk it out was going nowhere. We meet up for lunch today and I apologize saying I was tired and so does she. Her texts after that interaction really set off some flags. 

Her: I appreciate your resilient attitude but it makes me feel worse like I’m not being validated.

Me: What is it that feels invalidated?

Her: I’m just emotional and I want you to baby me and I’m starting to see you don’t have the patience for it

Me: You want me to baby you?

Her: I don’t think I’m resilient enough for you I’ll talk about it later.

Me: Ok I’m concerned you want me to baby you are you just being hyberbolic?

Her: Yes.

Me: Ok so how do you feel invalidated.

Her: I don’t know I’m just emotional and bad at relationships. (end of convo)

This irks me. That conversation went absolutely nowhere. She feels invalidated but can’t tell me why/how? That’s confusing. All the while I kinda feel like my basic needs are being dismissed. Like her needing cuddling at 4am trumps my need for sleep. I’m starting to feel like this girl hinges the value of a relationship on her ability to get physical attention. There are some other red flags. She told me she was raped when she was 16 and has been diagnosed with PTSD. She’s had panic atticks mid intercourse. I do my best to comfort her and let her know I don’t judge her at all for it. She asked me to be her bf about 2 weeks after dating and I said yes. Thought what the hey she’s cool and really likes me. No fast forward about a month to the present she tells me she loves me. I find it strange she can fall in love in 1 month. That was last night and she said it was fine if I wasn’t comfortable saying it back. But literally the next day says “I don’t know if I’m resilient enough for you.”? Can anyone help me make sense of this? I feel like this girl is tightening the screws on our relationship just one-month in. It has been 24 hrs since something that shouldn’t have been that big of a deal and she says she is “a mess” and is clearly having doubts about our relationship. Something seems real off about all this. Can someone help me make sense of her/my behavior?

TL:DR  My new gf needs a lot of physical attention and if she doesn't get it she becomes massively insecure and doubts the entire relationship.  If I try to communicate my side even in the nicest and supportive way possible she says I ""invalidate"" her.  ",12,0

As long as I can remember, it ruled my life. Most of my life, I suffered(and I use that word on purpose) with BPD. I had the most severe case many professionals have ever seen. That sounds like a brag but I assure you... It is not.

[Coles Notes (stolen from some medical page) : 
Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feel about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life. It includes a pattern of unstable intense relationships, distorted self-image, extreme emotions and impulsiveness.With borderline personality disorder, you have an intense fear of abandonment or instability, and you may have difficulty tolerating being alone. Yet inappropriate anger, impulsiveness and frequent mood swings may push others away, even though you want to have loving and lasting relationships... ]

These parts added by me:
Addiction is often a by-product of BPD because it causes extremely reckless and uncontrollable dangerous behaviour when the person is manic or triggered. Like: spending all your rent money on your friends, risky sexual behavior, shoplifting, very sudden fits of rage.. That sounds like one hell of a weekend.. Or life!   And then after, the person feels extremely ashamed and hates themself because their existence is solely based on the need to have everyone love them because they crave acceptance, security and have super heightened and insanely stronger emltiona. So when they love... It's to the death. But they see the world as black and white so if they don't obsessively love something, then ya.. It's not pretty for the recipient /designated object of that other emotion(H8). 

It's caused by early trauma. To sum it up. It's not usualy genetic.. It's preventable. But I definitely had bad luck when it came to my childhood. I mean if genocide or cancer is bad luck.. Then ya I had some bad luck. That's life. But then.. The BPD took the wheel. And it was not a smooth ride. 😂 Picture a toddler, hammered on moonshine, blindfolded, flying a plane.. Filled with other toddlers, all of them have guns and for some reason, only one rollerskate on. And they are being recklesssss. .. That's what it was like, my life. Like that flight. At 16, I was all of a sudden commanded to navigate adulthood. I lived on my own.. Because I had earned it? Now that sounds crazy but at the time it was a reward for good behavior(yep still fucking insane).. And all my friends my age were in high school with me and lived with their parents.. (So their parents were fucking weirdedddd out by that situation. As am I, Mel's mom! As am i!!!! Nobody could sleep over at my condo in Hull(don't😂..) unless they said they were at someone else's house.. . At way way too young, I had to take on all this adult responsibility, my BPD had just took flight(as we discussed) and so things were a fucking mess for oh.. Mm..10 years after that.. But that's not what this is about, remember? Focus!😉

If you knew me before 2 years ago, you definitely saw some shit. And I want to apologize for anyone I hurt. Truly. But I had no idea how sick I was. And I probably didn't care. But I've made significant progress in my life. I actually have a life. I'm woke. (That was for you, Ken Bryan *sleazy wink"")

But again. This is not about my past struggle. Or my very real, very dedicated efforts to being healthy, mentally. And guys!! Guess what?! My life's mission is now raising funds and awareness for mental health issues and educating the public on BPD!! Life's mission? Who the fuck...
Ya I'm an adult now! I go on missions.

... No.  THIS .. is about M-A-N-I-A.
Mania.. Sweet sweet mania. And I'm not kidding. It can be pretty sweet. Mania is the only symptom I still experience semi-regularly(3 times a month-ish). And I for the most part, ride it out in style because I have learmed to recognize it and usually don't go out in public(not true. So many 500 dollar trips to ANYWHERE have been made while manic. We need rugs. We need highlighters. WE. NEED. CAMOUFLAGE. CONSTRUCTION PAPER. NOW.)
My inward perception of mania is that I am now a brilliant, hilarious, psychic, gymnast. But outwardly, I've been known to look like a baby on cocaine(which we all know would be a waste. Kidding.. But omg me manic AND high... At a King st club. Screaming ideas a mile a minute... Oooooooh, 2014.. 15..16. Stop it. Those days are dead. 😂) .. My inward perception suggests that with mania my intelligence, humor, and intuition are fully realized. It’s not so much “more human than human” as it is “more human than non-manic human.” Tell that to Kanye at the White House. But I digress. There have been some bad decisions made in that time, clearly but now, through DBT I can manage them and spot them from a mile away. So they've kind of been appealing to me since I had the baby. 

Nothing makes you feel less human, more useless and the complete opposite of Beyonce, like suddenly being the stay at home mom that your friends dont even invite to places anymore... And like. I wouldn't go. But still. You start lying to yourself and saying you're the loneliest person on earth even though you most def spend hours upon hours dancing with a baby person, going to lunches with a baby person and ugly eating everything in sight(babies don't judge..........mine does.).. you go on frequent date nights and church and daily television binges with hub.. It's not the loneliest place on earth. I'm sure there is an abandoned boot somewhere in the mountains of Finland that has a rougher go than you. Chill. 

But it is a bit blahh when you're not used to it and it can lead to mild bouts of depression. Or in my case.. EVERYTHING IS SEVERE. SICK. But. That's where that sexy bitch, Mania plows in.
...there is nothing sexy about a plow. But somehow, here comes Mania, in head to toe lamé, a cowbell and sure enough, she is driving a plow.. Because she wants to shovel away that blah.. AND GET FUNKY. *Cue: Love Shack by The B52s.(I'll wait....)

But there are some dark sides to your mental mistress(that was fire).. You may(""hahahaha""-me) experience insomnia... 😃... You may become malnourished because you forget to eat(that one is pretty rare round here) or you may engage in manic self harm that you zone out into..you go to the bathroom, squeeze one pimple, and then 58 minutes later your entire face is swollen and bloody.. I've been there. That was awful. People are really mean and then all of a sudden your best friends at Mink in 2010 are calling you Scabby Gabby.. Oh that nickname fucking dominated my teens. The girl who made it up got murdered 2 years ago(not by me😐).. So i guess I didn't have it the worst.....

Anyways.. The aftermath of an episode usually brings on exhaustion, sometimes an emotional crash.. Depression... For me it's like.. Super hunger and sleepiness for 4 days. (Literally exactly like after cocaine, guys.. 😂 okay Dad, ill stop talking about cocaine.)

My episodes these days are actually now looking like: writing a bunch of comedy scripts in paragraphs that are NOT in order.. Ask Stas about the box of FUCK I sent him the other day... I was like ""hey wanna see it?"" And he said it was just a bunch of rambling paragraphs. (First of all Stas, you fob.. 😉jk. He's a genuine friend for life, that one.) But ya i told him i accidentally sent him a rough draft and that it wss supposed to be a brainstorm of different ideas. Well, Stas. You now know I was fucking lying to you. So... 

Moving on 😂. 
Guys. The goal of this piece was to show that not all symptoms of your mental health issue is always a curse. Sometimes there is a bright side.. Unless you like set fires alot .. Then ya, your life will probably be horrible forever...
Kidding! Don't burn our gazebo! It's mostly jokes. But actually, i meant everything ... ? I don't know. I'm not reading it again. 

Gab-OUT!

On top of being well educated and living in my dream city that I had to leave when my ex and I broke up, they are polyamorous and have several partners and friends and are navigating all of those relationships easily and successfully.

To paraphrase my therapists response:
First of all, they only appear to be having an easy time in their relationships. Unless it is a relationship you are a participant of, you can't know they complete dynamics of someone's relationship. Why do you think so many ""happy"" couples break up seemingly out of nowhere? People's private lives are private and you can't compare your whole story to their hilights.

But more importantly, it's not fair to compare yourself to them in general, especially as a person with BPD. Feeling like you're not as emotionally or socially developed as someone who has never struggled with BPD, especially when you're so early into your diagnosis or treatment for it is just not fair. They don't have to work as hard as you do, they haven't had this disorder present in all of their relationships up to this point, they haven't had to struggle the way that you have to understand theirself and challenge and unlearn behaviors the way that you have. To compare your progress to someone who gets to walk a safe, straight path while you're essentially climbing mount doom is not only a fruitless exercise, it dishonors your journey.

I'd like to end this post by saying that you are capable of recovery. A fellow BPD sufferer I met in an outpatient program once said to me "" recovery is not a straight line."" In fact, relapse is officially considered a part of the recovery process, according to the professional mental health community. Forgive yourself when you backslide. You're still looking forward. And when this work has paid off, you're going to be stronger than most people you know, because you didn't just get lucky and fall into your happiness by coincidence like most people. You carefully and meticulously created it for yourself. When you get there, I hope you can see everything that you've overcome to do so and you can be proud.",29,0

The first year was perfect, (which I think was just a honeymoon phase). I can’t pinpoint the exact moment it happened but sometime during the second year I began to spiral down the same depressive episodes I’ve experienced my whole life. This has continued into our third year together and he is at his breaking point. 

I was previously diagnosed with depression, GAD, and PTSD — it wasn’t until 9 days ago I was diagnosed with BPD. I’m currently awaiting for DBT and other coping methods, as the new diagnosis is absolutely terrifying for me. 

I’m scared because I don’t know what’s going to happen, I don’t know what thoughts are real or what my mind just came up with anymore. That thought alone sends me into extreme panic. 

Back to the point
    My boyfriend is the only person who has stayed the longest and not left due to my crazy behavior. I’m grateful for his support, but now I’m noticing the effects I’ve had on him. 
    He wants to help me and loves/cares about me, but I don’t see that until after the screaming and arguing. He genuinely isn’t doing anything wrong, but as soon as he tries to help or point out my behavior, I immediately jump on the defense and just attack. My thought process tells me to hurt him before he hurts me. 

That’s the thing though, he isn’t trying to hurt me, yet I’ve screamed at him, pushed him, threatened suicide, honestly the list goes on and on... I’ve told him he should just leave me and let me ruin my own life, but he’s so stubborn. Again, I love him so much for that, but I just can’t keep hurting him. 

It’s like I just see red and verbally attack and degrade. I’m not trying to, I’m just trying to protect myself. But now I know that’s not right and not appropriate behavior and I’m hurting the one and only person I have left in my life. 

We have talked about this and he doesn’t want to leave me, but I don’t want to damage him anymore.

 Please help. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do. 

How do you cope when you’re freaking the fuck out? Is there something I can do immediately in that situation to calm down? How can I feel safe without hurting someone else? 

The first step is noticing your wrongdoings, right? So now that I’ve noticed these issues, what can I do to save our relationship?

I have complex PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder.

Reality has really been hitting me these days. I am deeply saddened and angry how much this disorder has ripped apart my life. I am so angry at my parents for being the root cause of my disorder due to their abuse. I wonder what my life would look like if I had not gone through the abuse so I’d be free of the disorder.

 I am 26 and have been single for 6 years. Relationships are hard for me because I am emotionally unstable and have a deep fear of abandonment and rejection. I have struggled with friendships ever since I was in 2nd grade.

I do not have any true support people in my life because of my tendency to push people away, not trust others, and/or have a stormy end to our relationship. I was about to be homeless recently but my sister would not even take me in because she is not “comfortable” doing that. Yes, that made me mad and sad because I would have taken her in and I think she has become incredibly selfish.. but I also understand because she went through hell experiencing having both me and her mother as borderline individuals. I think my sis has ptsd from all the chaos in the family and is setting boundaries.

I have always wanted children but now am thinking maybe it’s not the best for me (at this time, anyways) because I fear messing up my kid like my mom did. I mean I have to learn how to have a healthy relationship first before I brought a child in. This fact makes me so sad.

I also have all these digestive issues and a weak immune system which I know is mainly because of this disorder and me being in a fight or flight mode so often due to so many triggers I have.

I struggle with jobs because stress is a big trigger for me. I just got my masters degree and wanted to be a therapist. I quit after a month of work and now I doubt I’ll be able to be a therapist.

I am currently unemployed as I  undergo intensive therapy. I am not dating, socializing with friends, having fun, traveling, and working like I wish I was. I feel like I have to let go of my old expectations and goals—-like moving, marriage and the kids for now. I just have to focus on solely my mental health like I should have been doing in the past.

A lot of sad realities I am facing. This disorder is so isolating and terrible.

A year ago I was contemplating admitting myself into a psych ward. The minute I left work I began to cry, I didn’t get along with my co-workers, I became really paranoid in regards to my work due to that. At the end of the day I just felt zapped if energy, I constantly was going between long depressive episodes bursts of temperamental anger to high obsessive energy bursts. I was unstable, I was in a relationship purely so I wouldn’t be alone, I had lost all my friends and was terrified. 

Now, I just started a new promotion at work and couldn’t be happier. I leave work with a smile, I get along with my co-workers, I still have energy after work. I began dancing last year, I developed a passion in my dance and it really helped to regulate my moods.

The direction he faced when he parked the truck meant I had to find a place to turn around, because the truck is big and I can't turn tight corners along a curb. (I'm an extremely anxious driver, and I'm not very good at it, or my anxiety tells me that at least) So I start freaking out a little bit and rubbing my fingers together and heavy breathing like I do when I'm feeling anxious, and start asking questions and I'm stuttering a little bit, and he gets irritated with me for being anxious, tells me it's not even a big thing to do it's just turning the truck around, I tell him I know logically it's not a big deal but knowing that doesn't change the fact that it makes me anxious. He says then stop freaking out and just do it it's nothing to be anxious about. We park, I turn around, fast forward to in the house. I patiently wait on the couch for him to put away groceries and sit down, and try to explain to him that I can't help that some situations make me anxious and that him getting irritated with me only makes it worse. He doesn't want to hear it, turns it around on me, says I had an attitude and that's why he got irritated. That isn't true. He always twists things into something different and it's always my fault any arguments happen. He refuses to listen when I try to point out behaviors that upset me or make situations worse for me, and he always turns it around on me. Literally every single time I try to point out that I dislike something he said or did, he shuts it down and gets loud or starts blaming me. Every fight ends with my condition being the reason for anything that happens between us. This makes me feel trapped, like I'm not allowed to have a problem with anything he does or says, and that in every bad situation, it's my fault and I did something wrong. I can't just stew on my negative emotions because that drags me down into a very down day for myself, and I can't stop thinking about it. Then it fuels the black and white thinking, and I start thinking very low of him and I struggle with that a lot already. Every now and then I get a chance to point out that I need to talk about things that bother me, he tells me I'm a big girl and I can get over it. How am I supposed to deal with this? Sorry for such a long post but it makes me feel very trapped and like he doesn't care about making things less hard for me, knowing full well about my condition.

Yet i’m the one with the BPD. I always closely saw a therapist and i still see one. What i am learning is that it’s not given to everyone to have help. 

I’m questioning if i made the right call but not for long. I realize that I’m alright. My heart is not in pieces because I’m not waiting for him to go out anymore. He hated going out.

137,You CAN support someone with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a healthy way.,52,a717fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/a717fp/you_can_support_someone_with_borderline/,10,1545063598.0,"The first thing I would suggest is to find a counselor, psychiatrist, or psychologist who specialized in Mood Disorders (preferably BOD), not only for yourself, but gently suggest it being a helpful idea, for your “someone” to think about, if they are not already seeing someone. But for you, because there WILL be days that you will feel overwhelmed, frustrated, upset, feeling like you want to thrown your hands up and throw in the proverbial towel. It is not an easy path you are choosing, however! It is an admirable one, and one that I would like to applaud you for taking.

Secondly, RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH I cannot stress this more. I will most likely repeat myself in this post (I am sorry. My meds make my mind mushy). So books! On BPD! I have a virtual library of these books in my living room within a week of finding out what my diagnosis was. It will be a lifesaver for you!

“I Hate You...Don’t Leave Me!” And it’s follow up book, (slightly less negativity towards BPD and the ability to be in a high functioning state of, what I will refer to like a remission, “Sometimes I Act Crazy”.  
Some other great books are (for families), “The Essential Family Guide To Borderline Personality Disorder”, “Stop Walking On Eggshells” (and it’s companion workbook. With the same name).  There are other workbooks that are great too, “The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook” (DBT has been shown to be very effective for pwBPD).  “The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Workbook For Personality Disorders”. “The Everything Guide To Borderline Personality 
Disorder”.  There is even a “Borderline Personality Disorder for Dummies”. (I kid not!).  I own ALL of these books. 

This is a path that will require you to pool all of your reserves of patience. Most pwBPD react from a place of pure emotion. Raw emotion, often times explosive, could be from out of nowhere, and can often times catch you off guard. You will need all of the patience you can muster. It is up to you to stay calm. Do not criticize, do not blame, just listen quietly. Listen, not just hear..but really listen. Offer empathy when needed, (I cannot stress how important this is), try to relate without retaliation or blame. I also do not like it when my husband sounds condescending with me. He also has a bad habit of giving me non verbals that make me feel like he is annoyed. **We will tend to internalize these things, even if it is not about us. These things also bother me. (He is working on these things with his therapist).

Often times PwBPD will say hurtful things that we do not mean. We say these things in the “heat of the moment”..impulsively without thought or regard, oftentimes (even if we say in that moment that we mean it), we do not mean what they say. These hurtful things we may say come from a place of pain and fear. Because we are accustomed to being abused and abandoned from others in the past. The reaction is to retaliate first to avoid the fear from happening to them again. A case case of fight or flight. When this happens, the best you can do keep in mind we do not mean to hurt you. Often times we will later come to regret the hurtful words we have said to you. We may also internalize those things and feel deeply terrible for them. Remind us that you understand that we are feeling a great deal of pain and fear, our words hurt, but regardless of what we say, you still love us and will be there for us. **There is what is called SET Communication Skill, that has been known to be effective when used with pwBPD. It is truly disheartening when I read all of the negativity regarding pwBPD. One bad experience does not damn us all.

Support

Support refers to an initial statement which indicates the loved one supports the person with borderline personality. It is a statement that begins with “I” and demonstrates concern and a desire to help. It can be anything that establishes a foundation for the relationship or interaction: “I want to try to help you feel better,” “I care about you,” or “I am worried about how you are feeling.”

The support statement is meant to reassure the BP that the relationship is a safe one, and that her needs matter even during this difficult moment.

Empathy

Empathy refers to communicating that the loved one understands what the BP is feeling, and focuses on “you.” It is not a conveyance of pity or sympathy, but instead a true awareness and validation of the feelings of the BP: “I see you are angry, and I understand how you can get mad at me,” “How frustrating this must be for you.”

It is important not to tell the BP how she is feeling, but instead put her demonstrated feelings into words. The goal is to convey a clear understanding of the uncomfortable feelings she is having and that they are OK to have, thus validating her feelings. Without such a statement of empathy, the BP may feel that her feelings are not understood. It is important to use feeling words, as in the examples above.

Truth

Truth refers to a realistic and honest assessment of the situation and the BPs role in solving the problem. It is an objective statement that focuses on the “it” — not on the subjective experience of the BP or Non-BP. Often the BP may seem to be asking, or demanding, something impossible, not taking an active role or responsibility in resolving the issue, or even presenting you with a “no-win” situation. The truth statement is meant to clearly and honestly respond to the difficult demand or behavior of the BP, while placing responsibility appropriately: “This is what I can do…,” “This is what will happen…,” “Remember when this happened before and how you felt so bad about it later.”

It is important to use the support and empathy statements first, so that the BP is better able to hearwhat you are saying, otherwise the truth statement may be experienced as little more than another, and expected, rejection creating even more defensiveness or anger.

Validation and Support Are Not Agreement

When first learning about SET, it can seem that you are being asked to agree with the BP. It important to clarify that validating feelings does not mean that you agree with them, only that you recognize that the BP is feeling them. The supportive communication described in the SET model does not mean that you are letting the BP off the hook, instead you are focusing on honest communication and ensuring that you are being heard, not just reacting to and defending against what is being said.

Some of us start to do what is called “splitting”. There was a time I thought I was starting to split from my husband. We were going through some really rough spots. He just kept reminding me that he loved me, he kept telling me that he wasn’t giving up on me, he kept telling me that he wasn’t going anywhere. A few hours later the thought of me splitting was gone. Every PwBPD is different though. But keep telling your PwBPD THAT YOU LOVE THEM, your support them and you aren’t going anywhere. You will be with them through the good and the bad, no matter what.

PwBPD need to know that there are boundaries. We cannot abuse our partners. But you must convey this in a way that does not sound critical or condescending. We are not children or babies, even if sometimes we act like it. We have the emotional intelligence of a child, but we are not ourselves children, (we don’t really like to be treated as such), but we can’t treat you badly either. That’s not really right). **We may try manipulation. If you catch this happening, Nip it in the bud. Do not allow us to manipulate. This should always be on everyone’s boundary list. My husband and I made a list of boundaries. He wrote down his for me, I even wrote down a list of mine for him. This is helpful.

All of our brains work differently. We all have different pathologies. BPD is a lot like Autism and Asburgers in that there are spectrums or functions of this disorder. Low to high functions. It is hard to say how one will react and how another won’t. **One aspect of pwBPD that will make a HUGE difference it if your pwBPD is self aware. If yours IS self aware, it will be easier to navigate through the storms. If your pwBPD is not self aware, I do not recommend trying any of these techniques until they are. The best you can do is to not engage, but try to encourage as best you can to seek professional specialized therapy. As harsh as it may sound, (and this is coming from a self aware pwBPD), you may have to use this as a boundary or even an ultimatum. Seek therapy or you will have to remove yourself from a situation in which your emotional health will be compromised. you should not have to subject yourself to any abuses either. I believe that everyone should be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their disabilities. One of my favorite things to say is “OWN YOUR $H!T!!” . But if you can help your pwBPD, please, at least try. One thing That I find disheartening are all the terrible, negative posts I see about pwBPD. One bad apple..all bad apples..you know where I am going with this. Well, I’ve made this analogy on another forum and I’ll do it here: if you had a loved one who had Alzheimer's or traumatic brain, would you verbally trash them all over the latest social forum and discard them like last years Kanye West fashion disaster? Because they too can be verbally abusive and at times even combative, BECAUSE they are confused, they are afraid because they are confused. People with Alzheimer’s are often compared to like almost childlike with some of their behaviors, temper tantrums if you will. They cannot help it. But you wouldn’t just discard them. The same goes for the person with traumatic brain injuries. They often rage because of neurological issues stemming from the area of the brain that controls emotional impulses, because it has been damaged. It has been shown that pwBPD MAY have neurological disabilities. Why isn’t is just as acceptable to work hard to work through the storms for our pwBPD loved ones?

If loved one just researches, reaches out for their own therapy (which I believe is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT), is patient, loving, DOESN'T GIVE UP, is dedicated, doesn’t give up, stays the course, goes to therapy, is patient, doesn’t give up, it can work, it WILL work, if you WANT IT TO WORK. My husband and I have been married 19 years. We are proof it can work.

I’ve been diagnosed but I never thought much on how I unintentionally hurt my friends (having them listen to me vent so often I’m sure it was tiring), getting too close too fast and hugging them more than they’re comfortable with (I literally just want to cuddle and take a nap with a friend. That should be a thing.), and so on. 

The biggest issue is: there is no fucking handbook to teach someone with BPD how often they should text a friend or asking a friend to hang out without being clingy. How often you can talk about how you’re feeling before they feel like an unpaid therapist. There isn’t an easy fix to understanding how to communicate in a healthy way. 

Along with a few other things going on in life I’m thinking about isolating myself because the fear of hurting someone is all consuming—which, ironically enough, would probably do the very thing I’m trying to avoid doing. I’m a loner by nature and spend my free time largely alone. But I enjoy the occasional hangout with a friend and I love just interacting with people I don’t know (I’m that person that chats in line at stores, I’m sorry to all the anxiety sufferers or those that simply hate that kind of thing). A quick laugh or a compliment. 

But lately I’ve started to look into my friendships I thought were healthy and I’m obsessed that every action I take is wrong. That I’m being overbearing or something. That there is a balance with communication that I can’t understand.

I’m not saying that my answer will be right for any one person who reads this, some may even say it is not fair to her (my mother), but my feelings are mine, and they are not right or wrong..they are mine for today and they are mine to own..and they are right for me and real to me. Feelings are not right or wrong, they just are.

Firstly she is my NUMBER ONE TRIGGER. I cannot forgive them (my parents) YET. I abhor the thought of mother right now. She has never been diagnosed and she never will be. She doesn’t think she has a problem. She WON’T apologize for ANYTHING. Almost ALL her children have disconnected from her and moved FAR away. One is even dead…overdose, right before she was supposed to “reconnect”. Everyone around her has deluded her and enables her. Nothing is wrong with HER.  

Even my therapist has told me, no, let me rephrase that, he has given me an ultimatum, you see your mother, and I will no longer be your therapist., pretty harsh yeah?   Well, he isn’t saying don’t see her “forever.”,  just until I am strong enough to face her.  He wants me to eventually have a relationship with her. But not right now. 

I am still very passive aggressive towards my mother. (I have just recently been diagnosed, AvPD &amp; BPD. But I am fairly sure, willing to bet my left..and right tit, that she is a NPB, and most likely a SLEW of many other comorbid disorders. But I can’t diagnose her. I am certain, no, I know, her upbringing was horrible, terrible, and in a way I really feel sorry for her. I hope that in the future, I don’t hate her. I HOPE. But the verdict is out in that one.  She can’t seem to take ownership of ANY of her shit.  Until she can, I’m not sure where our relationship will go. 

Why do I feel this way? Let me just give A FEW tid bits of my life, starting from my conception. Oh YEAH...we start THAT soon.  The things I explain herein, are only some snapshots of some of the things I remember. And some of the inappropriate and horrible things SHE told me, at an age when she should have been reading me fairytales and Sesame Street Golden books.  Most of my childhood I only remember like fragmented movie reels. Oftentimes I wonder if they were even real..they seem like dreams sometimes…or clips of movies.   And the good memories?  None ever included my mother, save for maybe one, at a beach in Okinawa, and all she was doing was lying on a beach chair. 

My trauma and neglect began when I was only a baby. I have a photo of myself as a baby, my mother holding me, I was only a year maybe a little more. My father standing off to the side, a very contemptuous look on his face, almost machevallian. You only need to see the look of disapproval on my face and my body language, i look to be pushing my mother away from me. (Oh my mother was a STELLAR mom! The biological dad, if I am to believe my mom, was a GEM too!)  Actually..all of them have ownership. And I am still raw in this self-awareness. I cannot forgive her (right now) because she cannot accept her true self, and get her own help. I digress.

My entire childhood is remembered in fragments and almost in a disassociated way. Half the time I am not even sure it is from a dream, something I may have imagined or it is something that was real. Most of my memories do not include my mother, hardly any are happy, none of those are with my mother. My sister and I were disposable to my mother when she remarried, because we were products of a man she wished to kill from her mind all together. She despised him, feared him, and we reminded her of him. Especially me, I looked just like him.  And according to him, (when he and I spoke at my sisters funeral, he absolutely wanted me, and loved me dearly when I was a baby., even showed me a photo in his wallet of me wearing a Phillies Flyers cap). 

[Mom, Bill &amp; baby me](https://imgur.com/a/FJo6BvH) 

But to her, we were disposable, and this new man and his family were more important to her. She devalued my self worth, starting at the age of 6 by placing me on diets, making me “suck in my stomach”...my body image became a compass for what my value was and acceptance as a girl, a teen and eventually a woman.  She did not protect me when her new husbands son beat me on regular basis and tormented me verbally, molested me as a 4/5 year old, further debasing my compass for my self worth. When I reached out for help from my parents, I was the one who usually got reprimanded for “tattling”, or whatever..he rarely got in trouble for anything.  

I was unprotected from. My mom knew about this. She had to. She took me to the doctors, they had to have said something. She removed my ability to have any self identification, trashing all items that made me feel like I could be an individual, more devaluing. My life became a constant dance of subservient whims to her at any cost to make her happy with me, thinking this is what I could do to gain her love. Knowing all to well that nothing was good enough for her. She is still the same.

So I still have trouble navigating feelings. Understanding that I can love and be loved. That I am worthy. Because I never do. I do not have any compasses for such things. Emotions are hard for me to navigate, and often times I feel them too intensely. I have no sense of self, and the best way I can describe it is that within the center of me there is just this this person that has no identity. It is an overwhelming feeling of emptiness..harkening back to my infancy, childhood and adolescence, stemming from abandonment and my Reactive Attachment Disorder.

All of these events created the perfect storm. Unfortunately, my sister, was not able to defeat her demons. Her death was not entirely accidental. You would think my mother would learn from that alone. All of these environmental circumstances created, set me up for trauma in the development of my limbic system, and for the development of C-PTSD, and Borderline Personality Disorder. The neglect and abuse through the years I needed nurturing was pervasive.

Up till just recently I tried desperately to seek the approval of my mother, thinking that this is what equaled “love”. Because of this, I constantly question whether I even KNOW what love is or feels like. The habits I observed from my mother throughout my life are what I believe were the “norm” for social and relationship behaviors. Manipulating, gaslighting, stonewalling, criticism, but the gold standard of them all? Emotional Blackmail (a powerful form of manipulation in which people close to us threaten directly or indirectly, to punish us if we don’t do what we want”), and FOG: fear, obligation, and guilt. She earned the gold medal. Let me give you some examples:

My mother disconnected with my sister because she decided to find her biological father and get to know him. The ultimatum was me or him. She completely shut her out.

My mom was taking a nap one early evening before dinner and had asked that someone come wake her before dinner. My daughter went up and knocked on her door to let her know it was time to eat, my mother did not answer so my daughter came back down. Everyone came back down and we began to eat. When my mother found out we started to eat without her she got extremely angry and locked herself in her room. She refused to come out. My dad had to go up and calm her down. It took him 45 min to come back down and finish his dinner. My mother indirectly made my daughter feel responsible and very upset about the way she actioned that evening.

So, although I am not at a point in my recovery to forgive my mother, I may not even be at a point in my recovery to say I don’t ever want to see her again. I can’t be around her since she is a source of great distress for me, as she is my most damaging trigger. But I know, for my own personal forgiveness…for my own personal healing, I must come to a place where I can let the anger, the resentment go. My relationship with her does not ever have to be the same again, and it need never have to be about her…and I need to be strong enough to hunker down MY boundaries with her, but I have to let the worst of who she is go so I can move on to be the best of who I can be.

153,Chronic Emptiness.,17,a8thvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/a8thvy/chronic_emptiness/,11,1545558014.0,"Hello. I’m new to this sub. In fact I rarely post on reddit at all. I’d like to start with the fact that I’ve had depression and anxiety for years. I was seeing a therapist for a long time and I was diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) as well as GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder). 

For the longest time in my life, everyone in my family would tell me I was being too sensitive about everything. Growing up, I felt A LOT. And I could never understand why they felt so little, or why I felt so intensely. When I was upset, even at the smallest things, it would push me to cry. Even if I get angry... I didn’t have a very good childhood. My parents were never around. I was always the black sheep of my family, and I have always felt like my parents love my sisters more, I still feel that way.

As I grew up, the one thing that plagued my mind was that I had no idea who I was. I knew what I wanted to be but I had no sense of self. I’d tell my boyfriend... I’m honestly nothing. I have nothing. It frustrated me that everyone has some plan to be someone but with all my plans, I still feel like I am nothing, nor am I achieving anything. 

Lately... I’ve been feeling this chronic sense of emptiness. I’ve always felt empty but never like this. My boyfriend has always given me love and attention whenever he has the time, and I often feel bad because I feel absolutely crazy needy... My boyfriend and I are in an LDR so it rly doesnt help we’re 16 hours apart. Lately, I’ve been feeling even more paranoid that he’s leaving me. He’s been super busy with work and logically I know this, but if I dont hear from him after some time, I immediately panic and go into a full on breakdown. Just a few days ago, we were on the phone and he was silent for awhile and I was paranoid thinking he was muting the call and unmuting just to speak to me.... it made me feel like he was hiding something, but really he was just quiet because he was falling asleep.

I’ve never been diagnosed for BPD, and I strongly believe I have BPD. I intend to get a diagnosis before the NY, but it would help if I had some form of advice on anything... I’ve been reading up on BPD extensively, but I still feel like I don’t know enough. ",17,0

I love this man more than anyone. I realized no matter how hard he tried. I would not accept any thing he did and I would put him down if he said something that my mind would twist and paint him as a villain. 

I hate myself. I wish I knew what BPD was before I got into this relationship. I always thought it was just my anxiety getting worse and making me paranoid which made me super attached to him. I thought I wasn’t worth being with him and I pushed him away. 

I really hate myself right now. I always knew the sexual abuse I experienced as a child caused me more harm, than JUST depression and anxiety. I also thought it was odd how in certain situations I would “zone out” a little too long. I could have save my relationship if I knew what was going. I feel like a horrible person. 

I wish I had gotten help a lot sooner. ",29,0

For example... 

Yesterday was my birthday and while I got a lot of lovely sweet wishes on Facebook, not many people in my real life gave a damn. Nobody got me a cake or took me to dinner or offered to buy me a drink. Not even a card. I’m a single mom and none of my family lives close so it’s not like I have an SO or mom or anyone to do anything. I feel silly, because it’s just a day, and why should anyone care? But it seriously hurts. I go out of my way for friends on their birthdays, but no one does for me. And I mean, I just feel like on the one day out of the year I might get some kind of nice treatment, it’d be my birthday and not even then does anyone care. Does that make sense? 

A friend made a big elaborate post about some girl who’s birthday was yesterday too, but couldn’t even send me a hbd text. This triggered me. I told him he was a piece of shit essentially and told him never to contact me again. 

My best friend didn’t call or text or anything either. I started thinking about other things she’s done in the past and was tempted to call and tell her to never talk to me again. Black and white splitting.

I know how crazy this sounds and I’m a little embarrassed. 

Anyway... I’m a social worker for developmentally disabled individuals. Thankfully I’m high functioning and I can hold my shit together when I have to. When it’s time to visit my client I stop my hysterical crying , fix my makeup and go in. This client is so sweet and innocent and lovely. Gave me candy and showed me her bedroom and everything she got for Christmas. When I left there I felt so happy. As I was driving I barely remembered why I was hysterically crying. So nobody cared about my birthday? Who cares. And my brain felt normal, like it was no longer inside out.

I hope this isn't a question that is asked a lot. 

Anyways, I've managed to get a lot of my symptoms under control, but they tend to come back at the worst times. It puts stress on my relationship, school, my wallet, etc. I've smoked marijuana in the past and I suppose it helped, but I've never done it long term, and I haven't smoked in months. I live in a state that recently legalized it so I'm considering taking it up casually for medical reasons. However, due to some personal reasons from the past, I'm kinda scared to start. Now I know everyone is different and it will help/affect different people in different ways, but I wanted to ask other people with BPD how marijuana effects them, since there isn't a lot of reliable info just from googling. 

So, I suppose my question to this community to those who smoke it, how does it help you? Do you feel any different? Do some symptoms go away, but not all? Does nothing change? Hell, does it make it worse? 

Any input would be super helpful to me, as I'm super cautious about putting myself in a situation that might worsen my mental state that I've worked so hard to achieve. 

[EDIT] Thank you all for taking the time to reply to me, it really means a lot. I am still on the fence about trying it but getting input from people with similar symptoms to my own has definitely helped.

Im 18 yo and i was diagnosed with BPD last year. It was a big shock for me but some things just became clear. I always felt like I'm just out of my body. I can do staff but i almost never feel like I'm doing it, it's like watching a film from first person POV. Sometimes i just try to go for a walk and focus on just walking to know that nobody else is doing it for me and I'm the one controlling it and sometimes a have moments where i feel myself. It's beautiful and I'm always very happy when i achieve such state. 
I saw a lot of posts on this subreddit like ""should i start smoking weed, will it help me? "" or just looking for a way to feel a thing. I want to tell you, weed or another drugs will never cure you or help. It's gonna work for a while and dissappear. It will never bring you back to your body. We all know how hard it is to control our emotional states but i want to give you, the person reading this, hope that you can achieve it. I did it in some part without any substances, medicines or drugs. I still deal with random exhaustion and depression or the worst thing for me, anger attacks. But i want to learn more about myself so i can fight it. BPD is one of the hardest things we have got  in our lifetime. I strongly belive that it's a part of us so we can become stronger. Everyday is a challenge for us and i just feel, that every little thing we do against our negative feelings is just teaching us how to be a good people. I often have brake downs, but I never lose hope that one day I will stand up in the morning and just say with all my heart ""damn, what a beautiful day"".
Maybe this is stupid but i just feel like posting it.
Have a good night guys.

204,I Wish That I Could Be Like the Cool Kids,16,ahsonw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/ahsonw/i_wish_that_i_could_be_like_the_cool_kids/,4,1547947138.0,"While I've never been diagnosed with BPD, I feel like I tick off a lot of the criteria. I'm glad I found this area since I've been struggling with something forever and never really had an outlet to ask about it or just to vent. 

It seems like whenever I meet someone (platonically) that I perceive as ""cool,"" I desperately try to become their friend. Usually this is benign, but sometimes leads to awkward situations like where I'm a client, for example -- *Oh my barber is really rad --  I need to hang out with him!*  I'll kind of slowly drop hints that we should hang out and then when they inevitably don't respond I get really depressed -- *Oh, why would they want to hang out with me? I'm not cool enough.* Of course in this example, it's not really typical to become friends with someone who's providing you a service.

I've had some nice people tell me that they didn't really want to hang out because I came on too strong, so I have that feedback. Ultimately, though, it's a never ending cycle. It's especially hard since I don't really know anyone in my city and attempts to meet people usually result in the above. 

I think it's also hitting me really hard lately since I'm getting older. I'm in my late 30's now and am really afraid of getting old. I feel like I've let me whole life slip away and am not going to have a lot of other chances to meet people and make friends. Maybe I just have an obsession with being ""cool?"" Whatever that is...

Anyway, I had to get that out because it's been eating away at me recently, especially since I just had another situation arise.",16,0

I am running the entire house, paying all bills, trying to keep things tidy in the face of increasing filth. He doesn’t want to or can’t be tidy. He rarely washes himself. 

There are important documents he needs to sign but he won’t do it. The more I ask, the more he refuses. The house needs maintenance but we can’t invite any workmen/women around because I’ll be at work and he’ll be asleep or won’t open the door.

So basically I've been very quiet and reserved my whole life, I got isolated heavily & teased for it during primary & high school which meant I hardly had friends, but the few ones I did make I became very attached to, which made me even more distraught when the small group of friends I had all turned against me after 2 years.

Anyway this all affected me so much to breaking point where I was self harming and had a suicide attempt so I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety during school, then when I left I was told it was highly likely I also had bpd. I display most of the symptoms associated but instead of having outbursts when upset or angry I just tend to bottle everything up and stay silent. Sometimes I do have mild outbursts but these only last around a minute or so then I'd go completely silent for a good while after. It kills me being like this, I wish I could just talk more, to family, to friends, to strangers, to colleagues and counsellors but I just can't. At this point I am so content with being silent and withdrawn most of the time, and I hate myself for it. I'm not in any sort of therapy at the moment because I know I won't be able to stick it out. I'm 21 and I know that's young but I'm not sure if I'll ever get over it, it's no way to live. ",19,0

237,Do you split? What is your story?,12,amleq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/amleq0/do_you_split_what_is_your_story/,15,1549161517.0,"What do you call it? 
Does it have a name?
What does it look like for you?

My “other side” has a name. When I am triggered I become someone else. The earliest I remember giving her a name was around 14 (40f) She’s kind of a joke to my parents as they refer to her when I get bitchy. They don’t understand any of this so it’s easy to dismiss.

My SO is the only one who ever really sees her. He literally calls her by her name and refers to her as if she’s a person.  When I’m triggered a monster takes over. I feel my personality change. I become ice cold and my words are venom. In this state, I exist only to verbally eviscerating the perceived wrong and source of my trigger. 

Mine has 4 stages.

The 1st is when I start to FEEL it. I try so hard to stop what is inevitably coming. I will exhaust myself trying to fend it off but that negative loop playing in my head won’t quit.  Then it’s like a switch gets flipped. I am not surprised because I have been feeling it build up. The other person however, only knows when it happens, I would imagine to them it’s like a sucker punch. 

The 2nd is the purge. My thoughts change when I’m in a triggered state. I would never be able to come up with the biting, sarcastic, surgically precise and cutting words that come out of my mouth in a normal state. In my eyes, I have been hurt and now I am compelled to make them feel that pain as well. 

This stage is dynamic with respect to how long it lasts. It can be brief and over in 10 mins or it can drag out for hours. Once the gates of hell open (aka my mouth) I don’t know how long it will last or what the damage will be as a result but I also DO NOT CARE when I’m in this state. 

The 3rd is like the 1st as I am the only one who knows when it’s over. The other person doesn’t. I still look the same as I looked 5 minutes before when I was completely out of my mind with hate and rage. It takes some time before my SO accepts it’s over. The only absolute with 1 and 3 is that the switches are extremely acute. There is nothing in between. It’s full blown and then *snap* its completely gone. 

The 4th stage looks something like remorse. When the switch turns off, I can see the irrationality of my behavior and I can acknowledge, that in a perfect world I could have handled it better/differently. What lacks for me at this stage is the actual remorse.  I am sincere in my apology.  I do NOT ever want to cause anyone to hurt. But I don’t FEEL bad about the things I said.  It’s as simple as ok it’s over, let’s all move along now. Nothing to see here folks. 

I never thought the splitting concept applied to me bc I don’t see things in life as black and white. I work in a profession that “takes sides” but I pride myself on seeing both sides of high conflict circumstances.  It gives me an edge at work as I am often able to use this quality to our benefit when it comes to strategizing. 

I realized tonight that I do in fact hold the characteristic of either all good or all bad with regard to the person closest to me. It is the all love or all hate that dictates my actions. ",12,0

Every single new professional seemed to throw a new diagnosis at me — major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, ADHD (though I’ve had this diagnosis since I was a kid), bipolar depression. Each new diagnosis brought their opinions as to why my life is an unstable hell.

The problem is, I never even knew some of the ways in which I thought or acted were incorrect. I thought it was natural to do everything in your power to know exactly where your SO was or to have the power to look at their phone as they texted someone. I did these things with an ex of mine almost 2 years ago and as it turns out, she had borderline personality disorder. At the time I only had a definitive diagnosis for ADHD but they suspected more was at play, but nobody could place what.

I now know it’s because of my lack of awareness for some of my thought processes and behaviors. Essentially our relationship was a back and forth tug-of-war that involved both of us displaying extreme insecurity, cutting ourselves, then getting angry at each other for doing so, so on and so forth. It was hell, but we feel for each other so hard at first that we said I love you to each other on the *first date.* Long story short, it ended with her having another boyfriend the whole time and me slicing my leg open while trying to manipulate her.

Fast forward to now, since my ex I have attempted to start up relationships a handful of times. I’ll cycle through having an insatiable sexual appetite and wanting an intimate relationship. The times I have tried the latter recently have all ended unpredictably and chaotically. 

I feel like I’m likely inclined to again cycle through wanting to have relations with multiple sexual partners but who knows (story of my life). Recently I have seemingly closed myself off pretty intensely, staying in my room a lot and cycling between so many projects I can’t even count (wanting to learn music, wanting to teach myself digital marketing, wanting to start businesses, wanting to write a book, etc.)

I feel like if I do venture out again that I need a warning label placed on me. Does anyone else feel like that? ",15,0

Pretty overwhelmed right now after seeing the self-harm post from 15 hours ago and receiving modmail from concerned subscribers. I work, I have two children, and I'm also student. I also currently going through a severe depressive episode and I'm struggling with alcohol abuse. I don't feel like I have the necessary time or skills required to properly mod this sub by myself. I feel that currently, I'm a little flaky and unreliable. So first, I would like to ask if anyone in the community would like to volunteer themselves for moderator privileges. Second, I would like to ask you, the community, how you would like to be governed. What rules do you like to see in a subreddit like this and how would you like them to be enforced? Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this post.

**EDIT: I've added a few rules so far but no requirement for trigger warnings. I'm not ready for that yet. It's funny, because you've all been thanking me for doing all this by myself but honnnaaaaays, you are really a self-made community that I've done very little to build. If you like it here, it's because YOU have made this a good place to be. So don't thank me, just pat yourselves on the back.**

**I'm going to try adding one mod (I'm a control freak and too much change too fast feels threatening lol, sorry). We've had a couple volunteers and I'm going to creep their post history and decide from there. Sorry if it takes me a few days. If anyone wants to nominate anyone they recognize who has offered in this thread to mod, please do so. This will help me. I'm hoping the rules and the new mod will keep us in check and not make trigger warnings necessary. I feel strongly about the rules that I added and I'd like to keep this place as free as possible. Self-harm pics and suicide advice are unnecessary and probably also unethical, so those are the main things that are out right now.**

I've been wondering if I have BPD with a bipolar disorder or if what I'm experiencing is common for people with BPD. Sometimes I'm very depressed all the time, but sometimes I feel like I can do anything. I'm booking concerts like I never did before, I'm planning my first trip by myself even though I know the money is gonna be extremely tight. I'm also flirting way too much with men, which could also just be my self-destructive behaviour. I'm eating way less than I did before because I just know I can lose weight and I don't care so much about food anymore. Actually I'm skipping two meals a day compared to an extra one (plus snacks) when I'm down.



Overall I feel like I have superpowers compared to when I feel like a complete loser when I'm on a depressive state of mind. Though sometimes I do feel depressed at the end of the day when I'm on a manic-like episode. It's been around 2 weeks since I'm feeling amazing and when it started, I thought ""Oh yeah. The amazing-superstar-wonderwoman marie-llama is back. I missed her."" It's been 4 years since I felt that way.

I want to buy a house and have a family but neither of those things will ever happen. I have 1 friend.

Not being able to truly tell if I’m being mistreated, or if I’m overreacting and distorting everything. One of the chief complaints people have for those with BPD is the over-sensitivity, twisting words, making things up entirely, and shifting the blame, and there is at least some validity to all of that (though I’ll speak for myself by saying it’s not intentional, usually ever, rather that’s what I think I heard or thought I remembered). So I always end up wondering sooner or later if I’m truly the instigator - the “wrong doer” - in a majority of situations, or if I really am being treated unfairly or harsh by even a “less extreme” person’s standards. How do I actually know? I know I can be irrational, so what if that’s the case, most of the time? How can I trust my own judgment? Could I ever trust my own judgment? Even talking about possible mistreatment to someone else may not matter, because it’s only my side of the story. I just feel like at the end of it all, my only option is to believe that I’m the sole (or nearly) cause of the problems, even if something about that doesn’t add up. I’m the borderline, I’m the overly emotional one, therefore, I’m usually by default the problem.

Speaking of extreme, the emotions are fucking unbearable. Even though I’ve made it through “episodes” (of rage, paranoia, grief, etc) before, in the moment it still feels like everything is crumbling down. It physically hurts, too. My whole body reacts. The adrenaline caused from stress, once there, is overwhelming and hard to bring down. And it’s difficult to explain to people that the pain isn’t exaggerated, that’s actually how I feel. It legitimately upsets me that much, and telling me it just shouldn’t doesn’t change the automatic response. Saying “I want to die” isn’t my trying to be manipulative, it feels like the only plausible escape. Nothing else is strong enough to break through it.
My impulses, naturally, have caused a lot of havoc for myself and those around me. Be it breaking something in a rage or saying the first worst thing I could think of aloud, whether or not I actually believe it. I feel something extremely, and I react accordingly. But they’re never things I necessarily “want” to do. It happens in a hot second and no reasonable thought manages to get in between the impulse and the action, rather it follows after, too late. Quite a bit of my impulsive “outbursts” aren’t actually witnessed by anyone (though there’s also many that are), but damage is still damage. Like I said with adrenaline, it’s usually a substantial, sudden rush, and it needs to be dealt with somehow. Be that attacking myself, breaking things, screaming, etc,. It would be no surprise if I died because of an impulse to stop it all by any means necessary.

Splitting. Any good that came before doesn’t exist once something negative comes into play, or is invalid. In arguments, for example, I can’t see the other person as someone who cares about me but is just angry. They must hate me. They’re sick of my shit. And therefore, I’ll mirror that. I’ll hate them too, if that’s how it’s going to be. Yet at the same time I think I deserve it, deep down - they should hate me. The confusion on being mistreated ties in here too, because, what if I’m just splitting rather than seeing the situation logically?  I can’t count how many friends I have lost from splitting, and half the time they didn’t even know or understand what had happened. 

Fear of abandonment (I know, I’m just listing the criteria). I don’t even realize how badly I have this issue until it arises. I don’t think that a lot of my actions are influenced by this fear. Sometimes I imagine being alone, thinking maybe then I’ll have peace - there will be no one around to hurt or be hurt by. But when push comes to shove, if I suspect it or if it’s actually happening, I panic. I’m devastated. If I don’t push them away myself, I’ll get desperate and “beg.” It’s humiliating.

Overall, just not feeling in control. Not of my memories, or emotions, or arguably my actions (yes, I know I can control them, though with immense difficulty and a lot of practice / therapy). My efforts to try to control the situation, good or bad, ultimately do nothing other than create more pain or very temporary relief.",47,0

Whenever some mild inconvenience or road block comes along for example, I am working on my graphic design brochure project for class and I can’t print it out at a print shop because I didn’t have it properly packaged for print, I immediately start wailing, crying and saying that I am giving up on this and maybe I should go into psychology because technology makes me too angry. Even during the week, I am too anxious to work on my projects because I fear failure and obstacles and I let my anxiety get to me. This goes for all my interests, I graze basically all areas of interests — start art projects, write, read about neuroscience, philosophy, quantum physics but I never finish anything because something stops me. 

I basically rage quit everything. I resort to watching youtube videos about who knows what. I watch ASMR videos to calm my anxiety that floods my emotions from not doing anything. I make myself furious from not doing anything, and when I do something I make my myself livid from not meeting expectations.

Feelings aren’t rational. 

There will be a day your partner, parent, sibling, child come to you upset and looking for guidance  and you’ll brush off the thing they’re upset about become in your mind the issue isn’t rational enough to warrant such strong feelings. 

An in an instant you will have shown that person that you don’t value their feelings or think their valid, when feelings were never rational. 

Emotions don’t play be the rules of whether it’s rational or not.

But they’re always valid. 

Just because you think it’s insignificant, doesn’t mean it is to the person you love, and by choosing to invalidate them, you’re showing them they cannot rely on you.

So even when you can’t fathom why they’re upset take a moment to remember feelings aren’t rational and right now a person you love is hurting, and if all you do is hold them and listen, even if you can’t understand or give good advice. They will have felt the love and comfort, and have seen the effort put in. And it will strengthen your bond.

It goes for both partners. ",17,0

And I mean, yeah, I take actions so that my family doesn’t view me differently or the relationship doesn’t change, but I’m not actively throwing myself into situations so that people take care of me.

Also, my “episodes” are entirely inward. I don’t cause a scene and lash out at my loved ones like classic BPD would say. I tend to be more self destructive, sabotaging my self harm recovery because I WANT to, and keeping myself closed off from progressing in life. 

One of the biggest things I feel like I can’t relate to is the relationship thing. I have an unstable relationship with my dad, and sometimes (but rarely) my mom. Yet, my boyfriend and I have been pretty solid, I broke up with him cuz I thought he’d leave me before, but I’ve learned my lesson. I just don’t have a lot of relationships to begin with because I don’t trust anyone enough to be my real friend. 

Idk, sometimes I feel like I’m not BPD because I’m not an extrovert or even ambivert. And it’s more of a struggle when people don’t take you seriously because they only see a few symptoms that are outward, but they can’t see the past and what you’ve thought.",45,0

Meds made me want to kill myself so I’ve been unmedicated this whole time. I’m actually really fucking traumatized from the meds because they landed me on a 5150 hold in a behavioral health center which ended up being extended to a whole fucking week.

That was about 11 years ago.

Now I’m 30, with two kids (ages 6, and 2.5). Engaged to the love of my life. Divorced from an awful narcissistic husband. 

Anyways, very depressed lately. Childhood traumas have consumed me. I see my 6 year old and I’ve realized that holy shit, I was not a normal little kid. I was doing weird shit that points directly to sexual molestation.

But the memories are repressed. Therefor my mind is constantly scanning my brain for any clues. A cousin came forward and said that my dad molested her. So now I’m convinced it was my own dad who molested me. 

I cannot stop thinking about this shit.

I want to do EMDR therapy in an attempt to possibly recover, or just get help processing this heavy shit that is absolutely taking over my life right now.

I feel so uninspired to do even the things that would normally bring me so much joy.

Anyways, just wanted to vent I guess. Maybe see if anyone can relate or if anyone has advice from experience. I really don’t know.

I've had an extremely chaotic life. And right now, this seems like a good place to bounce it off of, to see where I should go from here. I'm going to explain some of my more debilitating problems throughout my life, share a couple anecdotes, and I welcome all thoughts. Just please don't be outright cruel. Warning, there will be mentions of child abuse, domestic violence, rape, death, animal abuse and suicide/self harm. 

First, I'm a 30 year old woman with two kids who lives in NE Ohio. Family with heavy mental issues ranging from schizophrenia to bipolar. (Diagnosed) 

As a child I was isolated. My mother had a hard time making friends, so I only ever had them for a little while, and then suddenly we'd never see them again. My parents were on and off until I was 8, and my mom bought a house with my dad with an inheritance she received from an aunt. My mother is also potentially BPD and NPD, however, she refuses to see any kind of medical professional, as she blames buying this house on the klonopin she was taking at the time. But soon she stopped, and slept on the couch for the next five years. I wasn't allowed friends over, ever, and other parents would get mad at me overusing their hospitality without ever reciprocating, so I rarely got invited anywhere. 

Other parents also tended to have a problem with me on sight. To this day I don't understand why. I hadn't interacted with them, yet they wouldn't allow me near their kids. 

An example of this was my best friend, who was a boy a couple years younger than me. He lived with his grandparents, but his dad would come visit every so often (he was a trucker.) He got remarried, and brought stepmom to meet his kid once. I was there at the time, and I said hi and went home. The next couple weeks he kept making excuses not to play. And one day my dad went to hang out with my friend's grandpa, and I was making myself lunch. I had just set the tray down in front of the tv when my dad came inside and started screaming. He flipped the tray with my lunch. Apparently I had been playing I'll show you mine if you show me yours with this kid, according to stepmom, who i had only met the once. She saw us behind the garage. So I wasn't allowed on their property anymore. We were only allowed to play in our front yards. 

It goes without saying that none of that actually happened. But nobody believed me and I was a liar. My dad in particular didn't believe me. But nobody questioned it. That same year I was molested by a classmate in the woods behind my house. When that came out, nobody believed me either. 

So at that point I started acting out. My friends were as ephemeral as ever, and I wanted attention. All my attempts failed. I would leave weird notes in people's lockers nobody would find, I would write weird things on the walls in the bathrooms. My teachers kept taking the other kids side when I would get made fun of, so sometimes I would throw out teachers books or supplies. Eventually I got threatened with expulsion for ""assaulting"" a bus driver, except he was a friend, and I knocked his hat off while we were joking around. He said he got whiplash. The lawyer my mom hired got me off. 

So that was middle school. 

When I was in high school, my parents broke up. My mom was cheating and my only friend saw her in the act at a restaurant. My dad confronted her once she got home, and it turned into a knock down drag out fight. She got arrested. 

My dad lost his mind. Basically left me at home all the time to bang anything that moved. I flunked my 9th grade year. After a while he stopped paying the bills. I had to get my mom to save me before they cut the electric. So I moved out to my grandmas in the country. Those kids hated me more. I was a city goth kid with liberal views. I used to get enormous pamphlets left at my desk detailing how I was going to go to hell for supporting the LGBT community, I was sick for a couple days and when I came back dozens of people were shocked, saying ""we thought you killed yourself!"" 

Around this time is when I started cutting. 

The next year I had a friend. We ate lunch together, had classes together, and I was doing well. Then there was a class trip I wanted to take but I wasn't able to pay for. So I tried to earn the money from selling some of my meds, I was getting different ones every month and none of them worked. But some were fun. So my friend set something up. Turns out what she set up was me. They hated me. It was all a joke, and whenever they weren't with me they were making fun of me. So they figured out a way to get rid of me. And it worked. I got expelled. At this time I also had a boyfriend who went to another school. He dumped me, and started bragging how he had so many girls, and would finger them in class, and so on. I believed him, so I went on the offensive. To me. 

I went online and started fucking everyone I could. By the time I was 18 I had around 50 partners. Could be more. Idk. I'm lucky I didn't wind up dead or with AIDS. 

A couple years later I was in a relationship with an abusive alcoholic. I stayed for five years. We beat the shit out of each other almost daily. He drank away his trust fund and I just prayed. 

Idk. I'm tired now. I'll say more about that if anyone is interested. But I think this is enough for now. ",15,0

I have been following this subreddit for a while and wanted to share my own experiences.

As the title says, I am not diagnosed, except for having depression and social anxiety, however, I have always displayed a lot of the symptoms that a lot of personality disorders have in common. 
I especially have issues with my emotions, I really cannot control them. Sometimes I resort to self-harm and yes, I do experience suicidal thoughts, oftentimes intrusive, with really gory imagery.

Paranoia is also a huge issue of mine, I can never trust anyone close to me. I get attached and (very) jealous very easily. 

In addition, I display a lot of black-and-white thinking and I think in absolutes. I am often very intense and can get obsessive when it comes to relationships.

I initially thought I had ASPD because I displayed a lot of aggression, anger and impulsivity in childhood. I also engaged a lot in petty theft and really fucking despised authority (parents, teachers, etc..) 

Now, I seem to fit more into the description of someone who has BPD, and if it's worth noting, I did struggle with domestic abuse until I was 14 and some bullying/social isolation at school.

I am not really fussed about the labels, in fact, the reason why I seek to find a label that fits my symptoms in the first place is so that I can get the help necessary to ease their severity.

Some mental health professionals said it could be possible but didn't really worry too much about it because I didn't seem to ""pose a risk to others or myself"".

Also they don't seem to really want to help me with personality disorders, which, I mean, I don't know, it kind of sucks.

So, do you guys have any links, book titles, podcasts or whatever else that you use that helps you with your symptoms? Anything would be appreciated :)

Once I told my therapist he didn't even question it, he instantly seemed to agree and just proceeded to talk about it and I related to everything. I felt very validated after that, but it still feels like the people closest to me don't believe that I'm sick, possibly because of the persecutory delusion that is often attached to BPD. I was so delusional last year I destroyed my entire life. I hurt everyone in my life, pushed away all my friends, my family and my husband. I genuinely thought I was in danger. I was so delusional, and now I can't believe I lived thinking that was logical.

I've gotten used to not believing (or rather, questioning) my thoughts, though unfortunately I still get impulses and urges to distrust someone or hurt myself. And those happen in split seconds, I can't stop them. I'm trying to inform people on my problem, but I also feel like there's probably something I can do that I just haven't learned in therapy yet.

It feels like my shitty behavior haunts me. My family and my husband react to me as if I am the person I used to be, and it ends up hurting both parties in the end.

This is probably really vague and not well explained, it's just a scattered vent. I want to say to all of us that this is not our fault. It's not anyone's fault either. We're hypersensitive. We're not making it up.

I want to and scream and yell and lose my shit, but I can’t because it will just lead my abuser to start the cycle again, accusing me of not taking my meds, using my mental illness to gaslight me, insulting me and trying to control everything I do. It will just create more problems. My therapist thinks I’m doing so well, he wants to see me once a month instead of twice a month. He doesn’t know I’m breaking down crying on a nearly daily basis because I’m just so exhausted by life. An hour every other week is not enough time to talk about all my issues. My psychiatrist thinks I’m doing well too. I guess he feels that since I’m in such a “good mood” when I have an appointment with him, everything must be ok. Being happy that I get to talk to another human being other than my abuser often can make it seem like I’m in a good mood, but in reality, it’s just an act. I’m not even aware I’m doing it until I get home and beat myself up for missing another opportunity to tell someone I’m not doing well. My caseworker, who I’ve met all of twice in as many months told me I might be getting a new caseworker again. It’s my fifth one in four years. She tells me I can call her when I need help, but how do you reach out to someone you barely even know? I don’t know how to tell them I need help. Truthfully, what can they do? .They can’t get me away from my abuser. They can’t promise me a good future. They can’t promise me I won’t be alone for the rest of my life. They can’t make my family treat me with respect. They can’t make people like me. They can’t change who I am. It’s been 30 years of fighting on my own against myself and I’m exhausted. My future is so bleak. The only thing I’ve got going for me is that I don’t have substance abuse issues and I don’t self harm anymore.

I often found myself asking ""what is wrong with me?"" 

As I got older, I stayed in toxic and self-destructive relationships knowing that I deserved more and that the way I was being treated was unacceptable, but being alone was scary and impossible. While outside of these relationships, I felt empty and slept most of the time, so I battled my loneliness by being promiscuous and jumping from partner to partner because it made me feel something for a little bit, but I could not bring myself to be emotionally invested in any of them and would move on to the next partner. 

Once my promiscuity ran out, I turned to shopping because buying things made me feel happy. Now the amount of debt I'm in cannot be outweighed by the little trinkets and other stuff that I felt was so important to have. 

I also attach myself to people that I find endearing and funny. I mimic their behaviors that I like in hopes to being more likeable. I always thought it was odd, and even though I was conscious of it, I couldn't stop myself from making their habits my own. 

I hit my low a few months ago, where I seriously contemplated suicide. Suicide ideation has been a heavy presence since 7th grade, but never truly considered it an option, so when I found myself sitting on my bed at 4AM thinking about killing myself because my last abusive partner didn't want me back, I knew that I needed help. 

I sought therapy and anti-depressants. True friends I confided in told me right away that I sounded a lot like ""so and so"" that has BPD, so I started therapy and got confirmed that I too have BPD. So much of my life makes sense. All these years I wondered ""what is wrong with me?""

I experience this a lot. In attempts to trying to get close to someone, I can’t seem to stop thinking about them, and talk to them whenever I have the chance ... then after noticing something that makes me uneasy —usually from making assumptions, as if I can read minds— I run the other way as fast as I can and do my personal best in acting as if the person does not exist. 

Providing them with no explanation of my sudden absence.

Then realizing later that night that  (or maybe just another assumption) you’ve made a huge mistake. 

And then wanting to make things right, but knowing that those sudden periods of extreme lack of communication are rather rude, and feeling tension that may or may not exist with that person.

How do you confront that person and explain why you do such things? Especially if it is probable that you will do it again, though resentful of these actions.

I was upset at first but, when I looked at the signs and symptoms, it fit me. A lot of things suddenly snapped in place. 

One of the things is I have a tendency to feel emotions very strongly. Most commonly with negative emotions like sadness and anger; ESPECIALLY when I get angry. It feels like someone's lit my blood on fire and I can feel just this painful, burning, overwhelming rage in my chest. (I've never been violent towards anyone because of it and normally I just end up venting, passionately, to someone rather than take it out on them.)

When I released this information my doctor she wanted to put me on mood stabilizers. I agreed because I don't really like feeling a raging inferno in my chest. We started at a really low dose and nothing changed so we just upped it. 

Yesterday was the first time I've really been angry since that. But the thing is, I don't know how much of it is justified and how much of it is me overreacting. I had gotten some news about someone who had recently hurt me incredibly deeply. I'm hurt and I'm just so mad.

This person had come into my life and made herself a key part of it and then tore everything to shreds and left me to deal with it. I just found out some changes she made in her life and they're the same ones she tore out of mine. 

There's not really a way to repair to what happened (PM me if you want a really weird, convoluted, and somewhat boring rant) but the fact that she destroyed that aspect of my life and then inserted it into hers has re-opened the wound and I'm feeling the hurt and anger all over again. 

How do I know when I've gone from being reasonably upset and crossed into overreacting? I can't tell, I don't know. I don't know what's ""normal"" to feel and what's my illness. I haven't gone full inferno but I am definitely incredibly upset and angry, but I feel it's partly justified, this person has caused me a lot of hurt. But I'm not sure. 

If anyone has any suggestions on how I can view this a different way. Or an idea on how angry is too angry. Or tips on cooling myself down and walking away. Or anything. I'd really, really appreciate it. 

Tl;dr: I've recently been diagnosed and I just started mood stabalizers. New info on a time of my life that was difficult has come into play and I'm really upset. I can't tell if I'm reasonably upset or if I'm way too upset and need to talk to my psychiatrist.

I mention the hypocrisy of Trump getting elected by the very people who used to think everything about him was immoral and corrupt. He took that as a sign to get political.

My mistake for even bringing it up. I try to backpedal. I directly say ""I don't want to argue about it, sorry for mentioning it."" He argues. I push back on the concept of even having an argument at the moment.

He keeps arguing. I feel the good ol' BPD blood boil start. I fear I'm going to snap. I tell him ""shut the fuck up or I'm gonna throw you out of the car. I don't wanna argue about this with you."" I didn't even make it about his drunkenness; I genuinely did not want to have the argument with him about that topic, ever, under any circumstance. He kept arguing.

I pulled the car over and came to a complete stop. I told him shut up or get out. He kept trying to argue, so it just became ""Get out."" Had to say it about 3 times before he finally did.

I cried all the way home. Actually, I cried all the way to *his house* because I had to drop off some of his stuff that was in my car, then I went home. I got home and paced for a bit, then realized I abandoned a drunk man in the dark late at night on the side of the road several miles from his home. I called a mutual friend who is honestly a saint of a person. Told him what happened, how awful I felt, and about where to find him. Luckily this ex friend had his phone on him. They got together and he's home safe now.

Tonight wasn't supposed to be an existential crisis about my value as a human being. It was supposed to be watch hockey, go home, get sleep, go to work the next day refreshed after a solid night with people. Now I feel like *such* a tremendous piece of shit. Even now, I'm wondering how much of the story I've written here is actually how it happened and how much of it is that manipulative self-serving mental manipulation we people with BPD are known for. I'm really not going to miss the guy I got into it with, because what kind of dickhead decides arguing about politics is more important than getting home safely? But he's got a wife and kids. I know Coyotes are occasionally spotted on the road home. I couldn't just suck it up and deal with his belligerence? Goddamn it. And now I've dragged another friend into it and probably negatively impacted *that* friendship by dumping this in him. Goddamn it.

So, uh... Hi. I'm u/Srsface_I8C and I've been in denial about having BPD for some time. And I think I need help, or at least a support group that understands. So I decided to reach out tonight with this, I guess, instead of lurking first to figure out if this is even allowed or acceptable here.",25,0

It's the same cycle of craving for people, then establishing relationships with them. At first, all was well. But out of a sudden, I get trigger happy and finally I meet the bad after taste of being ""high"" for too long. The relationship is strained and just like that, I cut off every contact I have with the friends I've created. 

Cutting ties with people feels great; it's like I've sprouted wings and I no longer feel tensed. The craving for said person is gone. 

Then after awhile, I get empty and the cycle repeats. 

I've done this with online friends, but recently, I've done this to my real friends. 

They told me they got sick of me, and well, it is technically my fault for sharing mountain loads of rants and depression on them. They're the only ones who know the real me. Well, kinda. 

I'm rather apathetic; I'm also hypocritical and fake. I hate feeling so empty. I get told I'm an asshole, and my personality changes.

He doesn’t know what he needs in those moments and lashes out at me and those he loves.    What can I say or do to try to quell the anger?  Or am I resigned to just letting it happen as running itself out?  As that’s been my coping strategy.

&#x200B;

I know most of us, if not all of us, struggle with this. Always thinking we're making a scene because we react more strongly than others. We have this internalized invalidation which is one of the core issues of borderline and it sucks. For me it was my mom who always invalidated me as I grew up, unintentionally. I talked with her about this and she did not mean any of the things I internalized from the way she treated me, in fact, she didn't even always treat me unfairly, but somehow, I ended up internalizing that I'm making a scene.

&#x200B;

I think all of us deal with this, it's a combination of our ""biological"" (however you want to call it) emotional sensitivity and being invalidated in some way. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I just want to leave a nice message for whoever is seeing. You're not making a scene, alright? Yes, we are dramatic, because we feel things strongly, and yes, sometimes we overreact, but not because we're drama queens, we're just delusional sometimes. We think that things are worse than reality sometimes, and so our reactions are in big contrast with the reality of the situation, but it's still not ""making a scene"". It's just the psychotic side of borderline.

&#x200B;

I know that I at least have a lot of episodes when nothing is happening. Yesterday I was freaking the hell out over ordering take out. The guy got to my door, I opened it, said ""good afternoon, thank you, do I need to sign anything?"". I wasn't awkward, stuttering, the guy was smiling and polite, everything was fine. And yet I was freaking the fuck out inside. It makes no sense and it makes me unable to function outside. I'm actually quite capable of functioning, it's just that this illogical reaction is too energy-consuming, you know what I mean? I'd actually love to find other people who deal with the same kind of problem. 

&#x200B;

I'm currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, a very low dose of risperidone has helped me significantly in dealing with my paranoia, so if you struggle with that symptom of BPD, I highly recommend finding a psychiatrist. Preferably one with experience on BPD, since it's quite a complex condition. My psychiatrist doesn't even see it as an ""illness"" per se, but more like a condition that has many sides to it.

&#x200B;

Stay strong! And if you enjoyed this post, feel free to talk to me, I'd love to make more friends with borderline, I just ask you to not be aggressive with me, I understand some of us are still in that phase, I was in that phase of BPD last year and I wrecked my life pretty much, and I had to stop talking with a friend recently because her aggression spikes got out of hand.

For example, during any other week of the month, even including the week I'm on my period usually, if something starts to upset me, I can stop myself before reacting and think about what emotion I'm feeling, where that emotion is coming from, whether it's something I can change in the present and, if it's not, whether or not I want to affect my current situation by bringing it up the thing that isn't happening in the present.

But, during the week before I start my period, when I start getting upset, my mind goes chaotic and it's like the thoughts are flying every which way and I'm just trying to grab onto one of them and express it even though it doesn't have any relation to whatever I'm upset about and just causes more commotion.

I'm wondering if this could be happening because there are so many hormones built up waiting to be released, or if this theory is all in my head and my emotions just act up on a periodic basis. 

Does anyone else experience anything like this? Or have tips on how to help regulate emotions in a time of high hormonal activity?",72,0
411,DAE feel like a crazy person when having an episode?,24,bhcpj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/bhcpj0/dae_feel_like_a_crazy_person_when_having_an/,15,1556220206.0,"Hey guys. Sorry if this is long, i need someone to help me understand what is going on..  


 So i was diagnosed only 2 months ago, so i still don't know what is ""normal"" and what not and I'll need some advice..  

Today i was with my boyfriend of 3 years, and we were having a conversation about how things are different between us. We just got back together after a 3 month break up and I'm having trouble developing the same kinda feelings with him and i was explaining him that, and suddenly my thoughts started raising thinking all these God awful things and i just blacked out. Dissociated hard and couldn't say a single word. Was totally on auto pilot and a panic attack followed shortly.  

My boyfriend tried to help me as much as he could, he never experienced it before since it's just recently that all these started and we are in long distance relationship so he just picked our things and we got in the car.  

I was like a zombie the whole time. All the energy was sucked out of my body and i couldn't speak a single word, was shacking and felt like fainting. Now, all these I've experienced before, but what followed is what is concerning me. While i was driving home (yeah i was driving after this episode cuz i felt 100% self destructive) i felt and acted like a person out of its mind. Totally ""paranoid''?? I was being spastic i was scratching my self i was trying to break the wheel of the car,i was hitting on the door. Totally out of my mind. When i got home my mom saw me and she was terrified, she thought i was just acting? She said i lf i dont stop she is gonna take me to a psych ward. She said i have the look of a crazy person, totally staring to nothing and being all mad.  

I just locked her out of my room and cut my self until i could release everything from my system.  

Now the question is, is acting ""crazy"" normal? What happened to me? I feel so bad i don't know what happened! I got everyone terrified of me and j dont know what to do.",24,0

I had planned today over in my head a thousand times and each time I came up with the resolution that i wasn’t worth it or it would all go to shit and I’d waste my time again. 

After multiple unpleasant and expensive therapy intakes/initial interviews I was convinced that I wouldn’t find someone that’s right for me and would help me finally get the tools I needed to overcome these feelings, those thoughts, these actions. 

Nevertheless, I gave myself a chance. 

To my surprise, I proved myself wrong today. I had a couple opportunities and moments of weakness where I almost excused/bailed on it but in the end I forced myself to go out there. I was nervous and timid and honestly terrified of opening up so vulnerably to someone new again. Despite all of that in my head I still made it out to this intake session.

I honestly but cynically expected some sort of ridiculing or a condescending lecture when I would mention to her that I believed I had BPD. It’s happened before. So just like the other instances before, I hesitated then took a big gulp before the words left my lips.
 
“I need help. I have a strong feeling that I may be suffering from BPD. I need your guidance and professional perspective on this, I’ve never fully agreed with any of my previous diagnosis’” 

She sat across from me still and quiet and then without wasting a breath she thanked me for being very straightforward in my intentions with this therapy and even praised my awareness of self and the research I did into my symptoms. 

She was welcoming and even detailed more and more of the BPD symptoms(some that I would have never guessed) and ran the course with me and tried to pick apart my idea and reasoning for “why BPD?”. 

All in all for once, I felt heard and accepted. 

Anyone who I’ve ever mentioned this to before has one of two reactions:

- what the fuck is BPD?

- you shouldn’t be trying to diagnose yourself

Given, yes I can see clearly why those responses are appropriate but I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel invalidated by those words being said to me over and over. 

Downplaying my symptoms has kept me in this cycle of neglect and invalidation. 

It truly was a moment of clarity knowing that there is someone out there who knows, accepts, and believes they can help me with my BPD-like symptoms.

To anyone out there reading this, who may feel they aren’t good enough or worthy enough to seek and receive the care they need. Don’t let up, gather your strength, reorganize a plan and take that leap again. 

Today I began to come to terms with myself and accept my symptoms for what they are. 
Today marks the first day of my journey back home, to my loved ones, my friends, myself.
Today was another day, another chance at making a change in your life. Don’t let it pass. 
Today was a good day.

I do hope and wish that you have a good day too.",21,0

Regardless, they all are hard. Hard to shower, hard to be motivated, hard to stick to my goals, take my medication.  It’s hard to feel understood or accepted. You can’t expect anyone to understand.  Depression mocks BPD. While it does carry depression with it, if you Express issues you’re facing the world thinks you’re going through normal life shit….and you’re not. Its invalidating. But what can you expect? You don’t want the attention. And you don’t want to invalidate others…but you’re different. You’re not the same as them, and sometimes you just require more…. even if you wish you didn’t. 
In the darkest of days, you prefer to be alone. You don’t want their help. Their attention. You also don’t want to feel alone. You can’t win. What do you want? Who are you today? Will you be disappointed at yourself as you lay awake all night? Or will you feel accomplished and proud? It’s usually not the second. 
Life is what you make it…or so they say.  But what if you’re not the one making it? Someone else inside is living your life for you.  You’ll act like you’re having a good day, like you’re YOU. What they really don’t know is inside, beneath the sarcasm, the jokes, the laughter, you’re stressing about some uncertainty.  You’re paranoid about something. Always something.  You do not get a break.  You do not get to just enjoy the good days.  You’ve been broken so many times, when there is something good in your life the depression hits you immediately. The thought of all the good being taken from you like everything else overcomes you.  Nothing ever stays the same.  So, when things are bad, you keep that in mind. Nothing stays the same, so don’t end it over this.  You’ll be okay. Just like all the other times you thought you wouldn’t be okay.  But, look at you now…in-between now and the last episode, you made more good memories.  You can also flip it.  You’re so over come with happiness. But don’t be fooled.  Nothing stays the same.  It wont always be great.  So, don’t let yourself be happy now.  Think about the anxiety and sadness of when it changes instead.  Whatever you do, don’t you dare live in the moment.
This life will come with a high amount of shame. You’re ashamed of your thoughts, moods, actions, addiction hopping.  You’re ashamed of the lack of love and time you give to those you need the most.  Those you love the most.
You’ll spend a large amount of time sleeping.  If you sleep you can’t relapse on drinking or binge eating.  You can’t be destructive.  Power off and call it a day.  
Your body will wake up and live for the week, your mind will wake up next week.  You’ll be confused.  Everyone will be mad you don’t remember shit they told you.  You’ll have to clean the tornado you turned your house into.
You’ll realize while your body was awake and your mind was asleep, you didn’t shower for a week.  Do you give a shit? Absolutely not.  How could you. You’re fighting to stay awake and come back to you with all the strength you have left.
Now is the time you can welcome the insomnia.  You’ll stay awake for 3 weeks straight…and the fun starts all over.

I've been diagnosed for long enough to know that I have BPD. Got diagnosed over two years ago. My husband says it's spot on, and if he goes down the DSM list, I tick every box. You'd think I'd be okay with it because I was diagnosed Bipolar about a decade earlier. (Now I wonder if the Bipolar sysmptoms were BPD is disguise.) I've gotten a LOT better from a couple of years a DBT therapy. Around a year and a half after starting therapy was when I started thinking of myself as cured because, hey, I read somewhere BPD is curable with a year of DBT. And the suicidal thinking and actions had stopped. No more cutting. No more tantrums and hysterias. 

But I got over-confident and stopped using my DBT skills so much. I figured, ""I got this!"" Well, I didn't got this. Over the last couple of months, BPD symptoms (See? I can't even say just BPD, I had to add ""symptoms"" to distance myself from the disorder) have been creeping back and have reached suicidal thinking. (Don't worry. I've told my therapist and husband, and I don't have any intent or plans, just thoughts like, ""my husband would be better off if I were dead and he could find someone better."")

So at my husband's strong suggestion, I am hitting the DBT books again.

But the stigma of BPD is hard for me to take. I'm a perfectionist. Bipolar I handled because it's a ""brain disease"" but BPD is a fucking PERSONALITY DISORDER. I feel broken to be back in this place again. I feel like I have to accept the BPD diagnosis and I so don't want to. When it was just Bipolar, I was a stigma-fighting machine. I told people freely about it. But now that it's BPD, I haven't told one single person besides my DH. Not my adult kids, not my parents, not a single friend.

How do you guys cope with the stigma with others but also with yourself? How did you come to terms with your diagnosis?

We, as BPD's are HIGHLY sensitive and when focused can be extremely empathetic.  Most of the time my battle is to get out of my own head but I've discovered that when other people are super upset or disturbed and I quit judging them with my distorted views and look at them objectively with my highly sensitive mind, I can understand on a very deep level.   If a toddler or adult is acting very angry, when focused I can understand exactly why and often times diffuse and help the situation in a positive way.  

Everyone likes to rag on BPD's but channeled in the right direction I truly feel like it can be a super power. This can also work as an advantage in say dating or sales.  It's like being able to see into someone's soul and use it for good.  I know we all have our issues but I just wanted to share my experiance of what I think is a huge blessing having BPD.

450,I (22M) truly loved a girl who I think had BPD,19,bod5j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/bod5j2/i_22m_truly_loved_a_girl_who_i_think_had_bpd/,7,1557802168.0,"I loved a girl who, I think, has BPD and didn’t know it. She showed a lot, if not all, symptoms like destructive thoughts, feeling worthless / empty, intense fear of abandonment and of course all the mood swings. 

From the start I knew she would be special to me. Sometimes you just know and I KNEW. She was the first person I truly ever loved in my 22 years of living. We started talking and we could talk forever, never getting bored of each other. 

Very early on we talked about a lot of deep stuff and I found out about a lot of her “negatives” as she called it. She felt insecure about me leaving her, she hurt herself sometimes because it made her feel alive ( her words ) and quite some other things she saw as a negative. She always said she was worthless and I deserve better than her. Also she always said that if she is a bother I should tell her because we talked so much.

Silly silly person. ( Us calling each other “silly” was a positive thing )

I never felt like she was below me or that she was a bother. Never. Every time she said something like that I just wanted to hold her and assure her “You’re all I want so stop saying silly things and let me love you, silly girl”. When she had her breakdowns feeling she wasn’t enough I’d say something like “Imagine being enough. Now add more than that on top. That’s you to me.” I don’t know if she ever truely believed my words but I didn’t care. Every time she felt insecure I would assure her. I wanted her to feel secure when she was with me and just accept me loving her so freaking much.

There were times she hurt herself. All I wanted was her to be okay. I’d always wanted to be there for her so when she did hurt herself, I’d talk to her about her feelings and would try to get her to stop. In the end she did and I was so glad.

She was so intense when she loved me and I felt GREAT. We UNDERSTOOD each other. It was almost as if she obssessed with me and I certainly was with her. I miss being someone’s absolute favorite person. I miss being her absolute favorite person.

In the end problems happened and she always avoided talking about them or trying to fix them which in the end became too much and that was the start of the end between us. I tried so hard to talk things through with her but she always saw it purely negative and as arguing so we never truely worked things out. 

In the end that crack became bigger and bigger and at one point I realized there is a really big chance she might have BPD. I mentioned this to her and she got super upset and at that point “discarded” me. Stopped talking to me completely. All I wanted was to help her. If she truly did have BPD, she could put a finger on the cause of all these intense negative feelings she had and start working on them. That was my thought process. Turns out I am now the super bad guy she hates.

This was a year ago and I still wish her the best. I just wanted to love her so much and make her feel loved. I think I succeeded at times. Even tho she’s not in my life any more I truly hope she’s feeling better these days. Doesn’t seem like it when I occasionally visit her twitter but I still want her to be happy. 

I wanted to give that to her. I truly did.",19,0

So they pulled some frozen food from the basement. Some Tyson anytizers and onion tater tots. It infuriated me because I fully planned on making a stir fry, but my dad doesn’t like that stuff, so that didn’t happen.

Ugh, it pissed me off more than it should have. So I dug through the freezer again and found half a bag of green beans, at least that would make up for it. I’d get SOME nutrition tonight. But as soon as I pulled out a pot and placed it on the stove, my mom called from the living room, “just throw them in the microwave, why do you always dirty so many dishes when you don’t have to?”

Pissed. Me. Off.

So screw it, I’m not having beans, I’ll just sit on the couch and eat a preservative packed, sugary, unhealthy meal like a fatass.

The fact that I’m upset by FOOD is triggering the hell out of me. I feel like a five year old. And that just irritates me so much more, it’s a viscous cycle.

Coworker texted back that she apologizes totally and is very sorry to put me in that position.

She checked us in at the main office and we parted ways in the familiar hallway lined with painted handprints. My mother kissed my sister on the forehead and my sister scurried out the door leading towards the older children’s classrooms, and she said goodbye to me and I exited through my appropriate door. As I was walking across the concrete expanse graffitied with hopscotch remains and juvenile art, my legs stopped working. I stood, motionless, staring at the three classroom modular that housed Ms. Watson’s 2nd grade class, my class. My mind was a runner, and today it was on the track, working in circles.   Why didn’t my mother kiss me before we parted?  My mother always kisses me before school. Why did she only kiss Alexandra? She must love Alexandra. She must not love me anymore… That’s ridiculous, she’s my mom, she has to love me. Why didn’t she kiss me? She doesn’t love me.   There was no buildup, no small pooling of tears in the eyelids that escaped down the face once the threshold was met. No. My tears erupt like a geyser.   My legs started working again and I would walk a few feet, then stop again. I finally reached the brick wall, that stood alone, isolated in the sea of concrete. We would play kickball against it. It stood about 3/4 of the way to the classroom.  It probably had been around 3 minutes by then, way longer than the necessary time to get from point A to point B, but way less time I had thought given the war being waged in my head between the logical and emotionally distraught.   “I know my mother loves me, but she didn’t kiss me on my forehead, maybe she forgot,” the logical would assert. “But then why did she only kiss Alexandra? She must love her more than me. She must not love me,” the emotional pleaded.  Tears continued to fall from my face, dropping onto the blacktop. I can’t think of anything else but getting resolution. Getting sweet reassurance.   I was supposed to be in class with all the normal emotionally stable children being led by Ms. Watson; the logical and rational parts of my brain wanted so badly for me to plug the geyser, wipe the wetness from my face, plaster a smile on, and walk into the classroom. But, it was too late, the wave of emotion crashed over my mind, drowning any logic left.   I sprinted in the opposite direction. Away from my 2nd grade classroom, away from my responsibilities, through the unlocked gate, supposed to be keeping us kids in and the world out.   I escaped to the front of the school, tears still bursting, looking up and down the road for our family’s green minivan and my mother. But she wasn’t in sight. What was in sight was a police car swerving to the side of the road 20 feet away from me, and the officer approaching.  “Are you alright,” he asked. The tears I had been holding in with breathe escaped with the “yes” The officer, now concerned, asked why I wasn’t in school. “I need my mom. I need my mom.” I was a broken record.   And, like the universe was listening to my crisis, the green minivan turned the corner and parked haphazardly next to the police car. My mother ran to me and embraced me, looking from me to the officer and asked, “What’s wrong.”  And with that hug, the anxiety retreated. I knew my mother loved me, maybe not as much as my sister. But, she still loved me.   Now I had to deal with the aftermath of the outbreak. I had no words to explain the situation to the officer or to my mother. Even as a 2nd grader, I knew my behavior was irrational. I knew it wasn’t normal for me to run out of school, crying, getting the attention of law enforcement, and demanding the authority to see my mommy because she didn’t give me my daily forehead kiss. None of my classmates would have made the scene I had.   That night, I slept in my sister’s bed, because at the age of 7, I was still incapable of sleeping alone. As I was flirting with the idea of sleep, my sister rolled over to face me. She asked me why I had done it. Even in the vulnerability of sleepiness, and in the comfort of her bed, I kept it in. I couldn’t explain it. I was a slave to my emotions. They wouldn’t understand. I was so ashamed.   People claim that mental illness and personality disorders develop in the teenage years and early twenties of individuals that had some traumatic childhood. But I have been battling and hiding (sometimes not well) my oversensitivity and borderline characteristics my entire life, and I didn’t have a rough or traumatic childhood.   I recently was talking to my mother about personalities, and I was sharing with her that I am an INFJ. INFJs are the rarest personality type and are plagued by the feeling that no one understands us. Having a personality disorder that makes me an emotional rollercoaster on top of that personality is not easy. My mother eyes lit up, “you have always been a peculiar person, it was so difficult being your mother because I felt like I was never able to give you what you needed.”   I think she finally understood that she wasn’t a bad mother to me, even though sometimes I made her feel like one. In reality, she loved me and cared for me and tried to support me through my tough emotional times. She even showed up to school and ate lunches with me when I began crying every night that I had no friends.  She didn’t fail me, she didn’t love Alexandra more. She just knew how to be a mother to Alexandra and was unsure how to for me.",19,0

I have lost my Independence and don't have the coping skills to build myself up on their terms. And I hate it. I hate living here like this and I'm pissed that I don't have the ability to see a long term plan of action thru. 
So now I have to leave because if I stay and don't meet expectations this situation will end anyway. The only way I know how to financially take care of myself leads to isolation. That leads me to resent my job and romanticizing being with my family and completely underestimate what it would really take for me to be normal and with my family and forget I'm not quite wired for that. Not that it's not possible it's just a bit out of my reach... And has been for awhile. 

So I throw all my stuff in a bag again. Get on a plane book a room after I've scanned Google maps and have decided on a place that feels... Welcoming, and I'm off. I'm excited I'm rejuvenated and energized at finally being in the driver's seat of my life again.

But it happened recently, one of my friends walked past me, and they glanced at me and waved, but their facial micro expression was slightly disgusted looking, and they seemed avoidant of my friendly effort to wave at them.
So, here we have a slight amount of rejection and bpd goes “let’s just dial that up to 100” and I snap at them “well hello to you too X” they don’t respond and keep walking.

2 hours later, I’m here alone and I’m letting it land where I can deal with it. I feel heavily betrayed of trust, rejected, disliked, abandoned, etc. And I’m having internal debates about whether or not to and exactly how I’m going to stop being their friend and distance myself from them. All because of a micro expression on their face and an absence of “hey”.

So I’m just trying to be present, keep in mind that my impulses are going to do harm to both of us, and to deal with my reaction mindfully and not allow it to poison how I frame the future and not allow it any inertia.

Investing in people is so painful, because it opens me up to being triggered when I receive the slightest rejection. And I can’t even share that with people, it’s too much for them to handle to know that I go through such intense emotions over basically nothing.

My therapist gave me some advice on dealing with paranoia that I want to share because it might help everyone else.

&#x200B;

My husband has trouble expressing himself. This led to me often distrusting whether he was telling me everything that was going on. But he'd always tell me that he's trying his best to say everything, and I always doubted him.

&#x200B;

So my therapist advised me to ask myself ""does this person have the tools to do this another way?"", I've tried applying this question in a few places and it's changing my perspective and having good results.

&#x200B;

Basically, in that situation, my husband does not have the tools to express himself any further or better. By asking myself that question, I know that he has trouble with expressing himself, so I answer ""no, he does not have the tools"", which leads me to stop doubting that he's hiding anything on purpose and makes me more empathizing and focus on helping him if possible.

Idolizing our SO and putting them on a pedestal before basically tearing it all down and breaking it apart simply because a switch in our brain is signaled and they are now this evil person even when they did nothing wrong. But I don’t know how to stop it. 

I got with my SO knowing and wanting a poly relationship because if i focus too much of myself on 1 person I idolize them and when they do something wrong I lose it all and end up losing them completely. 

I was seeing a few other people but I’ve pushed them away or broke up with them in way or another over the past 6 months. But this last one, who I was having feelings for. I just stopped talking to him. I haven’t responded to messages or emails. I’ve basically just stopped communicating. I’m not only doing it to him but three of my best friends I haven’t been able to respond to. I can’t message them, I can’t call them. there some sort of block where I just can’t communicate with them. 

Now I feel like I’m doing the same with my SO. I have no interest in talking to them even though they live with me, I don’t want to do anything with them including sexually. (I don’t have any sort of sexual cravings right now period) I even feel like I’m picking arguments with them for no reason. 

I’m in therapy, I’m on medication but I can’t stop myself. I feel like im spiraling and pushing everyone away to the point I’ll be alone because I feel like that’s what I deserve. How could anyone love me the way that I am when I do this to them?

 A few days ago i had a conversation with my therapist about my friendships, and i was telling her how every single one abandonded me and how it all went down.  So today i was thinking one friend in particular and went through all the conversations we had to remind myself exactly when she started ignoring me, and when i read the conversation i was in complete shock. For a whole year now i remember it 100% differently. I thought from the start that she was ignoring me and ignoring all my invites, and avoiding me and now re-reading all of these i don't see it like that. I actually managed to be cold at her and ignoring her just because i thought she was intentionally avoiding me.     


I just realized that all this time i just made scenarios in my head of her abandoning me just because we were not going out us much as we used to.   


This really made me question all my lost friendships and how i might also have a big part of responsibility in the relationship ending. Just me overreacting and expecting everyone to leave me. I am in complete shock and feel really really bad.

Been struggling with all the stress and anxiety of not having a new loving living situation lined up before my current one ends on 7/5, my credit has been in the shitter for the last 3 years and that hurts my ability to get any apartment. 

I'm the sole person paying off the debt that both me and my partner incurred together due to him losing his job. We cant both pay to the debt because then we wouldn't be able to afford much else.

My mother loves to show boat that shes supportive, but dangles the carrot of her love over me if I make any decisions she doesnt approve of. Even at 27, I'm not allowed to make my own choices without her judgement and cold shoulder (if she doesnt like something I say or do).

I got into a driving dispute and a jerk on the road that I thought hit me. In a panic I'm trying to get him to pull over all while he's screaming at me and calling me awful vulgar names (dont wanna say if it is a trigger for someone, basically called me a see you next Tuesday multiple times). Claiming I'm making up false accusations and that women are all the same (dont know where that came from either).

And I just lose it once he speeds off and breakdown crying. I could barely hold it together to get to my job and just sob in the parking lot.

All i did was text my sister ""can you talk?"". She called me back 2 mins later and just let me vent and cry. She was being so supportive of me, telling me I'm doing all the right things and that as long as I'm doing what makes me happy, then nothing else matters. She said it sounded like I needed a vacation and not just for a weekend. She told me she'd hug me if she could. She doesnt know exactly what goes on in my brain, but she said she'd rather hear me out and give me solutions to help me, rather than berate me for doing what's perceived as the ""wrong choice"".

I love my sister. She really came through for me when I felt my most isolated. 

Dont give up on anyone who is your support system and shows they have your back. They are trying just like us and even though she doesnt have any mental health issues, my sister has always done her best to learn and understand.

Idk what else I was trying to say. This got long, but I just felt like letting some of my morning go because all I've done since 750 this morning is constantly cry.",27,0

BPD is forever and it’s going to be a struggle forever, dealing with all the intense emotions, and facing that deep down soul crushing debilitating pain that fills every thought, knowing full well..... even with therapy and maybe some remission, that it’ll be a hour to hour daily struggle to cope. All the while pushing and hurting everyone around you. 

There is no rational feeling to feel this way, childhood trauma of a mom who left me at 4, shouldn’t be the fucking defining moment that broke me forever. 

I’m fucking sick and tired of the invisible pain. It’s always there. You Slowly wake in the morning and it’s there sitting on your chest waiting for you to open your eyes and face the pain all over again. I dread waking up. I stay awake most nights dreading sleep even though sleep means I don’t deal with the pain because I know waking up won’t bring relief.

Constantly filled with hopelessness. Why should I have hope knowing That everything I touch, I either hurt, destroy, obsess over, and push away. Always worried a partner will leave or cheat or god knows what else. The BPD brain assumes the worst. Being in love is the only relief, but I know I’ll sabotage that too because I always have. The more I learn about BPD, the worse I’m feeling. Being diagnosed has been a blessing and a curse. Blessing only because now I know why I am the way I am. The curse is knowing everything you do is affected by it in one way or another. And you look back at your life and realize everything you did was also related to it. Looking in the past or the future only make it harder. Make the pain go away 😭",10,0

554,Five Things Wot I Do When I Feel Sad and/or Depressed,44,c5fgvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/c5fgvt/five_things_wot_i_do_when_i_feel_sad_andor/,3,1561497335.0,"So I thought I'd share some strategies and quick-checks I've put together over the past year or two, partly as an exercise for myself, but mostly in case anyone else might find them useful or thought-provoking. I don't think I've solved sadness or anything that bombastic: I've just learned that there are a few things that sometimes help me not to get overwhelmed. Basically, when I notice that I am feeling sad and/or depressed, here are some of the questions I ask myself:

1. **Have I eaten?** When I'm depressed I don't eat properly, often going 24 hrs without noticing I haven't eaten or eating only snacks all day. This obviously plays hell with my mood. If I haven't eaten in the last 4 hours or so, I make toast with peanut butter and I have a glass of fruit-juice, just in case. Sometimes it helps.

2. **Do I have a good reason to be sad?** Sometimes it's ok to be sad. If I can pinpoint why I am sad, I can judge better how sad it's ok to be, and what self-care I might need: a shower? a chat with a friend? watching Notting Hill for the ninety-sixth time?

3. **Is there a distraction which appeals?** I keep a list of ten good distractions in my wallet for days when I want to get out of my head but can't remember how. My most reliable is to go and look at some trees, but I can't always get out of the house, with the anxiety and all, so there are others...

4. **Are there any friends in my phone I haven't heard from lately?** Somehow, asking friends how they are seems to help me access other emotions. Maybe it's a sympathetic thing; I don't know. Of course if they're sad too, we end up in a right mess, but that's all part of the fun. Anyway, it's always nice to hear from friends, and it prevents me from adding loneliness to the heap of things I'm sad about.

5. **What's the cat up to?** My cat is supremely unaffected by my state of mind, in a way that transcends mere emotion. If there were a school of Buddhism that centred around licking one's own arse, he would be a master. It's oddly comforting to know that the sadness I am feeling is not affecting the world at large: somehow it seems to put it into context. If ever you're feeling sad and want to know what my cat is up to, my DMs are open...

Let me know if this is welcome or not: I'd love to hear your strategies and tips. <3",44,0

602,Unexpected results after medication,42,cdkxvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/cdkxvj/unexpected_results_after_medication/,9,1563213700.0,"So as many of you may know borderline is often accompanied with other disorders and the most common ones would be addiction, eating disorders, depression, and anxiety. I suffered my entire life (well I’d say since the age of 8-9) with body dysmorphia. As my BPD got worse so did my self harming behaviors and I eventually developed an eating disorder. At one point I started taking amphetamines to suppress my appetite, while also taking laxatives and purging when I could. Everyday I’d look in the mirror and see an obese person. I hated myself and couldn’t stomach to look in the mirror more than the necessary time to brush my hair. 

At the same time this was happening, my BPD was at its worst. I got to a point where I couldn’t even really function in the real world and I had to apply for disability at my school under the incorrect diagnosis of PTSD. This counselor diagnosed me with PTSD because she couldn’t get ahold of my old records to see my long term behaviors. She only ever saw the face I put on for her and I tried to explain that I was putting on a face but she didn’t listen and diagnosed me with ptsd which then allowed me to file for disability. 

In my school the disabled students are provided free psychiatric help. I finally was able to get ahold of my records and was properly diagnosed (again) with borderline (no surprises considering I was already diagnosed with it twice before) this doctor then prescribed me a cocktail of drugs. 

The situation: these drugs are known for causing weight gain. I already thought I looked like a monster so I couldn’t imagine gaining more weight! I weighed out my options and realized that if I didn’t at least try the medication I’d have to continue living in constant misery, anxiety, and anger which would most likely lead to my death or incarceration. 

Result: I took the meds for several weeks and told myself I wasn’t allowed to look in the mirror. I used a hand mirror to brush my hair so I couldn’t look at my body. I stepped on the scale and I had gained about 5 pounds. This hurt but surprisingly I didn’t flip out like I usually do. 

This morning I decided to allow myself to look in the mirror. I saw a woman. Not a monster but an average sized woman. What happened to the monster? 

While I’m obviously not cured of BPD or my ED and BD... because I still will purge every once and a while and skip meals when I can... I was shocked to see what I actually looked like. While I wouldn’t say I’m hot by any means... I’m definitely at least a little cute I think. I wonder how long I’ll be able to see myself as a person. Did the meds clear up my distorted self image? Also very importantly, how come nobody told me I was wearing clothes that don’t fit me? I mean my sweater goes down to my knees and no one said anything lol. 

But I just wanted to share this, or at least document it for when I may see myself as a monster again.",42,0

I know this to be true, I was never diagnosed however im going to see a doctor to get tested tomorrow for it. But I am extremely manipulative and I know how to change myself to get what i want. in my natural state, im shy, cautious, dont talk much, reclusive, lonely, and insecure. But for example if I were to decide that I want to go find a doctor that will load me up with a bunch  of different happy pills at once, I will make it happen. 9/10 I walk into a doctors office and leave with exactly what i came for no if ands or buts about it (i.e tricking a doctor into writing a script of xanax with 5 refills placed on it with no prior history of ever taking benzodizapines) . This is just an example. I have systems for everything that i want, and I'm so confident in them based on the personality of the person i am attempting to engineer, that i know it will work almost every single time. What i want to understand, is why people with BPD almost always (not 100% of time just most) have abilities to naturally by highly manipulative, and honestly seem to have a very high iq and situational awareness. They seem to see the world in a way that is so bright, with such high expectations and people with BPD understand what true loyalty should be based on the fact that they have never obtained it themselves. They make amazing lovers and friends are super loyal up until the point where they expect the friendship to end and unintentionally cause it to. There upsides and downsides to BPD. but sometimes it appears to me that BPD is less like a disorder and kinda like a little superpower with a lot of unwanted side effects. Forgive me for a lack of better way to describe. But i want to understand why people with BPD seem to have such a naturally high level of understanding of the world, more than the average joe. What does bpd do to the brain to cause that ""high functioning"" and im not trying to glorify BPD or anyone with it because it is extremely hard to deal with, and im also not trying to trash talk normal people.

My BPD hasn’t helped at all, I ended up leaving him the first time because all the things he would do and say to me lead me to believe he would just end up abandoning me anyway. And then I went back now we’re stuck in limbo and he “doesn’t know what he wants.”

BPD is making it hard to walk away this time but I feel like he doesn’t want to be with me he just doesn’t want anyone else to have me. Idk. But I think logically it’s time to walk away. 

If he doesn’t know if he wants to be with me then he probably just doesn’t want to be with me at all?

I see a psychiatrist and am on multiple meds that don’t help me extremely, but help me nonetheless. The medication that made the most change in my life is Xanax and a beta blocker to help my physical symptoms. 

I’m worried to get help, because I’m scared that they’ll take away my Xanax, which is the only medication that’s made a difference in my life. Does anyone have any advice on this? Do you think they’d take the medicine from me, even though it helps me immensely from experiencing extreme episodes of anxiety and stops my panic attacks from happening most of the time. I’m diagnosed with PTSD, so I feel like it helps with that the most given my frequent panic attacks. 

I’m just now accepting, willing to accept although I’ve known for a year or so that this is probably my diagnosis. But I’m terrified of getting help, because I don’t want them to strip me of all the medications that have helped me thus far.

Edit to say, I talked to my psychiatrist. He says we’ll talk about it more at my next appointment, but reassured me that he is the only one controlling my medications and that he wouldn’t take me off something that’s benefitting my life, just because of a diagnosis.

Emotions were very hard to come by in my house, and it only was until I was an adult that I learned how to say “I love you” and “I’m sorry” because I was never raised or heard these things from my parents. My dad and I have especially always had a rocky relationship. Iv been reading that it can be triggered when naturally sensitive children grow up in a household that lacks the ability to care for such children. Iv always been sensitive and was often told I was faking emotion for attention. This has happened since I was a kid to the point where I was crying and writhing on the floor in pain, but wasn’t believed I was sick until I threw up all over the floor. My dad even beat the shit out of me once, and everyone in my family refuses to believe it ever happened. Even my sister who witnessed the whole ordeal.

My parents split when I was ten, which happened to coincide with the beginning of my extreme bout of anorexia that ended up with my parents loosing custody of me when I was 16. The hospital did things to torture me, and everyone refuses to admit it despite me diagnosed with PTSD regarding the whole ordeal. My parents also played “hot potato” when it came to me and constantly threw me out of the house or bounced me from one house to the other to me being in hotels and staying in a trap house when I was 16. My dad disowned me on multiple occasions growing up and cut off all support for me, leaving me with my mom to take sole care of me (my parents didn’t officially get divorced till I was 18, so there was no custody arrangement or child support). I was also raped when I was in high school and sexually abused by multiple men growing up, something that when I came to my mother about, she blamed me and couldn’t believe it was anyone’s fault but my own. Since I was 18, Iv had more traumatic stuff happen to me that has left me in the state I’m in now. But I’m just talking about my childhood here. 

It hurts that my parents think that I had a perfect childhood and that they wouldn’t change a thing if they could go back in time with hindsight and do anything about it. I hate that they think I had a “perfect” childhood, when it feels like growing up I was never believed, abandoned, and had an unstable life without love from my parents. My dad and I still have a horrible relationship with eachother, while my mom has been my rock and I’m able to forgive her for the way I was treated by her growing up. I know she did the best she could, given that she was raised without love from her own parents and didn’t know anything otherwise. Despite that, it still hurts that she thinks I have nobody but myself to blame for my problems, and I feel very damaged and hurt and to blame for everything.",30,0

I've been in a 14 year friendship and 10 year relationship with my girlfriend who has BPD. 

We have 1 daughter who is seven. I have another son from a previous marriage who is 13. I'm just so horribly saddened about the decline of this relationship. 

I'll start by saying that she isn't the worst case of the bunch by any means but it's considerable as I no longer have any patience with her and although she doesn't know it yet, I'm done, called my realtor this morning to ask questions about selling my house, that's how serious I am. 

I live in a household that isn't a home, and that's all I've ever wanted. 

A brief history, we have been together romantically for 10 years. Sex is phenomenal. Everything else sucks badly. We have split up before, and actually went our seperate ways for about a year before getting back together, something I wholeheartedly wish I hadn't done. We split up because she was cheating on me, 2 months before our fully paid for wedding none the less. 

When we got back together, after many conversations, I saw something in her, a change to someone who seemingly acted more adult like, used a bit more logic for decision making, things like that. I told myself, I know it will always be rough, but if she can be self aware and actually consider that her behavior makes everything so hard, I could live with that. An apology every once in awhile goes a long way. Now I know those behaviors are just exactly what she did when we first got together, manipulating me into believing she is something she is not. 

I was going to start house shopping around the time we started seeing eachother again, so after some serious conversations, we looked for a house together, and I bought a way larger and nicer one than I would have if I was single. I did it for us. She had horrible credit at the time, so the mortgage is in my name, and boy do I hear that shit all the time. This was 2 years ago. 

That brings us to now, and it's been 2 and a half years since we bought the house. 

Let me share with you what I feel like. I feel like I live miserably for the greater good. I live with someone who is self-aware of who she is, knows all about it, refuses to acknowledge it, continues to make emotional childlike decisions without interjecting any logic, blames me for all of it, changes conversations that have happened in the reality we share, sometimes 20 seconds after they happen to promote her own agenda, lies profusely to everyone around her about the dumbest shit only to get herself over with anyone, starved for attention, starved for validation, and virtue signals and does anything for anyone except me. She can deliver meals on wheels, but can't clean a bathroom, or pick up after herself. It actually disgusts me. I feel crazy, and I'm not. I'm mad all the time, and it's because of her, and yes I know I can change that dynamic, but now I'm broken and feel helpless. 

Worse off is that she actually projects all of this behavior onto me, and I live under a MASSIVE double standard on almost everything. 

I have tried, and I mean I have really tried to make this work, but unfortunately I have come to the realization that I can't pay for this anymore. That's what I am doing, I am paying for this. And it's not fair. Her entire existence is what it is because I create it. All I've ever asked for is some sembalence of working on it, some progress. 

I used to have this fear that she would go off and fix herself for someone else, but I have lost that fear, because now I know that she can't, or better yet won't. 

I cry for my daughter, because if we are not together she won't have a constant adult around, and it scares the shit out of me. 

I can actually type about this for ages, there is so much to say, so many stories to tell. 

Let me finish by saying, this isn't a knock on anyone. I don't judge, I know all too well what this is like for anyone involved. It's fucking life ruining, and I'm sorry for anyone who has this drag them down. I'm not looking for anything here. I just wanted to vent, and maybe, just maybe have one of you tell me I'm wrong, if I am. 

And before anyone starts picking me apart, I know who I am, I have anger issues and I'm co-dependant in the way that I perceive love as being needed. I often can't start a conversation correctly because of my anger. My relationship is FUCKING MADDENING and it's so hard to stay calm about it. That's why I am so drawn to broken women, because of the feeling of being needed. I'm working on that, I guess we will just see how I choose my next partner.",32,0

I often find myself drifting away Into fictional situations, either 'just' inside my head OR infornt of the mirror etc. I wonder if anyone of you does similar things and if it can be considered a form of dissociation or not.

Typical situations :

1. Im going for a stroll and listen to music. I often feel like I can still see what's around me but my thoughts are in another world. A world where I am the artists who's singing this song on a stage / I see my own music video for that song and how specific people in my life would feel abkjt that (mostly I want to impress them, make them think how wonderful I am) sometimes I even act like I'm singing that song because we're filming the music video for it (and it gets awkward when someone passes me by going for a stroll as well lol) 

2. I start talking to myself /talking out loud (mostly in front of the mirror) and see myself in a talk show or an interview. I hear the imaginary questions of the interviewer in my head and answer them out loud while looking at my reflection. When I do this, most of the time I feel more self confident and prettier. I also know why I'm in this Talkshow or why I'm being interviewed ( there's a certain topic I talk about : a book I've written, an album I recorded, interview about my BPD)

During these moments Im completely away from reality.

We talked about dissociation and different forms of dissociation in group therapy today and I maybe expirienced extreme dissociation like I described at first maybe two or three times in my life but the interview / famous person thing happens A Lot.

When I'm not in this other imaginary world I feel total emptiness, like I'm completely unable to feel sadness or happiness. ( sometimes I feel a lot of pressure inside of me, but that's all) 

Do you know this? Would you classify this as being dissociative?

That being said, I've had many of the symptoms since I was a child.  My entire life, I've felt abandoned by friends, family, and significant others which has only contributed to the growing BPD.  When I turned eighteen, I was immediately given the diagnosis.  

Since that day, I'm now twenty one (twenty two in September), life has put it's boot on my head and shoved me into the mud even deeper.  I feel like I'm drowning every day.  I have tried regular therapy and it wasn't helpful.  At first, I used to lie to my therapists because I was scared.  Eventually I opened up and started to fully apply myself, yet nothing changed.  As I continued my education, I learned that most therapy isn't effective for a person with BPD, and that certain types of therapy were geared for people like me (namely, dialectical behavior therapy).  When I tried to find a therapist that did this, the only one I found refused to treat me.  This felt like a deathblow in my head.  Here this woman was, capable of helping, but she wouldn't/couldn't.  It felt like life was laughing at me. As I did more research, I realized the immense lack of therapists who did this style of therapy, and I lost hope. Now I'm not doing any sort of therapy.

Every day I wake up not knowing what explosive mood changes I might have that day.  Most people have had one or two days like this, where they might go from an extreme euphoria, to anger, to anxiety, to paranoia, to back to anger all in the span of several hours.  Most of you can somewhat relate and understand this.  That's my daily life.  My emotions are uncontrollable and intense, which is only exacerbated by the fact that I consider myself very logical, yet my emotions follow no logic.  It creates a battle in my head between what I know to be right and wrong, what I know I should be feeling, versus what I actual do feel. 

I'm impulsive.  With money, I spend it left and right on things I shouldn't.  When I'm in the moment, I struggle to tell myself no.  I think, ""Oh, well I'll make this money up next paycheck."" But things add up when you're always saying that.  Not just with money; I drive like a madman.  I make faulty decisions without thinking when I get angry. I speak without thinking constantly.  

I'm scared of human connection yet that's all I want.  I have been shoved to the outskirts of society.  I work a job where I interact very little with people, which I need because of my social anxiety.  I go to college online.  My friends from high school drifted apart and eventually stopped speaking to me, and don't return my attempts to reach out.  I am quite literally alone; save for my cat.  I have no idea how or where to meet people.  This loneliness is only intensified in public; I see all these other humans walking around with a significant other, talking in groups of friends they have deep bonds with. It makes me realize what I'm missing, and I have no idea how to get there.  Thus far all of my attempts to meet people have failed.  Apparently, people think it's weird when one, lone person approaches an already-established group. 

Reading this, most of you will understand or relate to the feelings I have.  I just want to know how to cope.  I'm at the end of my rope.  I have no energy left to fight, and I don't think I'm going to be okay if I can't find some way to cope, find a human connection, anything to help the way I feel.  If any of you have advice, or have similar stories, I would love to hear.  I simply want to know I'm not alone. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you did.",31,0

I am a 17 year old who cut ties with my mother 6 months ago. I've lived with my grandmother my whole life and then with my father, visiting my mother every weekend.

She would get angry if I tried to not go visit her for one day if I had a birthday party.

Since I was around 8, my mother started smoking weed and told me about it. I promised to keep it a secret since it's illegal in my country and my father would be angry at her. They haven't had any kind of relationship from the moment she got pregnant, I'm the only thing going on between them.

Nowadays my mother would pick me up at around 9pm, drive around until 3am smoking weed with the windows closed and then we would hang out in her house until 5am with her smoking weed with the windows closed once again. I would get really sleepy all the time and fuck up everything I tried to do such as like stepping on things or not doing what she asked me the right way. She always screams for at least an hour about how retarded and stupid and pathetic I am..

I resent her for telling me as a child that her bffs kid should be her kid instead of me because she liked wearing pink and I didn't. I resent her for screaming at me for hours until I started having panic attacks not knowing what to do. I resent her for making me feel all this guilt like it's all my fault. I have nightmares about running away from her crying and screaming every single night.

For a year now in every argument she would tell me that if I was going to give her all this trouble then I should just leave her life for good. The first time I heard this I cried like a baby.. I was so shocked. How could she say this to me? I hold everything in so my father doesn't lash out on her. I take care of her when she's sick. I hear her problems for hours. How could she want me gone for good?

She said that same thing so many times that one day I decided to never see or contact her again for my own well being. She was shocked. She told me later I couldn't do this and I couldn't live without her in my life, and that I was her karma and things like that. I told her I'm not doing this to hurt you, I'm doing this to heal myself

She proceeded to tell me I was mentally ill.

So I stopped answering.

Now I have constant panic attacks and nightmares and I can't argue with anyone without crying uncontrollably, so my father took me to see a therapist.

This therapist wants me to involve my mother back into my life.

She says my mother has borderline disorder and that it's not her fault, and that whenever she starts shouting I should just leave.

I can't do this. Whenever I'm with her I'm a little girl again trapped in a dark whole. I am so scared. Please give me advice on how to cope with this I cant go on living like this

I was just recently diagnosed, which I STILL don't understand, and am struggling. 

This is going to sound SO self-centered, and I am sorry. So, I have amazing friends who love me and support me, who would let me disrupt their lives at 3AM and even their spouses would welcome me with open arms, friends who know that I've had two hospital stays in the last six months, who know my body is covered in scar tissue, and who want to spend time with me, invite me to dinner, clubbing, concerts, painting, etc. I have friends I've known for two weeks and some that I am still close to over ten years later. My college best friend flew out to see me ASAP, after I told her about the hospital stay, even though we hadn't seen each other in two years. I am SO fortunate to have such incredible people in my life. 

However, I STILL can't feel close to anyone. I still cannot get rid of this gnawing emptiness in my chest. I constantly feel different from the people around me. When I go through the mental check list of who I can talk to when I'm at my lowest, it's so hard to pin down even one person. Not to mention, I don't want to throw my wrench into their lives. They all have so much going on and it's hard to decide which internal crisis is worth burdening anyone with. It's hard to make the right call. And with friends, there's all the guilt. 

I know I fuck up a lot, and every misstep I make impacts our friendships and their lives. One of my closest friends was livid when I made my second attempt and I couldn't understand it until he yelled at me for being selfish and told me that he needed time to grieve, because he thought I was going to die. And he needed to grieve because I tried to. My actions and impulsiveness constantly push them away. I am so quick to set fire to bridges and they are the ones to put them out. I burden them with that responsibility and for some reason they still want me in their lives.

Having friends is really nice and can be an incredible source of support, but doesn't change the loneliness. It just provides a distraction. And every time I mess up, it hurts to watch the people I care about be hurt by me. It hurts when they pull away. It hurts when they leave. But thinking about this makes me feel SO SELFISH. I have friends because THEY are incredible people and they choose to see and love the soft parts of me, despite all the prickly parts. They're there to even help soften some of the hard tips. But I still feel so lonely. I still feel like I'm out here by myself, with no one to turn to, and I'm just all alone. I feel like no one understands, and I feel like a horrible person for it.

I don't even know what I'm trying to say. I just feel totally crazy and out of control. 

TLDR; I feel like a selfish, ungrateful person for putting my friends in complicated situations, and for complaining about my feelings about them when they're really amazing people. But I also cannot feel close to anyone and it's eating away at me.",24,0

I was in love but couldn’t seem t stay faithful anytime things in the relationship got rough. I also had extremely manipulative tendencies. Through therapy we’ve discussed my childhood and all of my unhealthy coping mechanisms, infidelity, manipulation, etc.
Yesterday I brought up feeling like maybe I have codependency issues and my therapist brought me a check list. I thought it was a codependency questionnaire of some kind, and every single thing on the list seemed spot on. 
He tentatively “diagnosed” me with BPD, at the very least because I show all the signs of it and so we can move from there.

Through the discussion about it, every single thing we talked about made so much sense in every relationship I’ve been in, and so far everything I’ve read has been exactly my experience.

The one thing I’m held up on, though, is the extreme anger and rage. I don’t have that. I don’t have outbursts or anything, I can always hold them back and stay calm (at least in those situations). But a lot of times I do get some sort of internalized anger or resentment. I’m usually able to move away from it fairly quickly.

Any similar stories to mine?

My parents both worked full time so I frequently came home at 5 years old to an empty house for an hour or so until my mom got home - I have a memory of hiding behind the couch one day until my mom got home because I was so afraid to be there alone. I use to have reoccurring dreams of someone breaking into our house and staring into my bedroom. To my knowledge we never had a break in, but it always seemed odd to me how much I feared someone hurting me. 

My dad is an addict and relapsed on and off as I was growing up.

I walked to and from school by myself most days. I use to have two imaginary friends that I walked with in elementary school I remember that instantly made me feel safe.

I played pretend, a lot. I didn't stop playing with dolls and figurines until about 8th grade.

I engaged in reckless behavior with guys and drugs/alcohol.

I didn't have a lot of friends because I think I was too needy/clingy. (I still don't have a lot of friends)

No matter how much self care I seem to do, I am still insecure and constantly apologizing for who I am.

People take advantage of me because I care too much for everyone and anyone.

I fidget, can't focus, and overthinking everything.

I am self-destructive and find comfort in being that way - feeling like I deserve it.

I just started listening to his podcast and whilst he had some nice little things to say, he claims to have “rid himself” of BPD and there is alot of him bigging himself up. He also seems to talk off the top of a pedestal that i suppose he has built himself. 

“The good news is that conditions like BPD are entirely curable” .... hmmm....

Just getting to the end of the podcast now stinks of narcissism. Critiquing both mental health professionals and people with BPD who “claim” that it is only treatable and not curable.


He has also said that “Folks with BPD” can’t experience “genuine” love and are not “empaths”

Also noticed that on his website that he has “paid international services” that are text/phone/chat based.... not really sure how one guy could manage all that....

Have a look at his website if you want. It’s mainly just him talking about himself.

www.thelastsymptom.com  (i DO NOT recommend his “services” this is just to have a little look at and get the stench of suspicion)

Tbh, he smells like a wannabe cult leader. (In the episode i am listening to he suggests that you should break up with your partner //unless you are married// whilst you are in “recovery” so... isolate yourself and only text with him i guess... hmm)

I would say that whilst he has a couple of nice insights, thats it.

I have a big problem with emotional triggers leading to sort of 'fever episodes' of thinking.

An example: I have a cuckolding fantasy, which my girlfriend knows about. Yesterday, she checked out a guy in a bar (totally normally, ie instinctively, not to signal it to me) and it set me off. She tried to keep me calm but I basically hit rock bottom, felt massively insecure, couldn't make myself feel any worth or attractiveness of being desired even though she is sitting right there with me telling me she loves me and wants me. 

Not long after that she had to go home and I think I got abandonment anxiety. So the spiral continued with texting, me asking her not to hate me and so on. 

We talked on the phone later and resolved it but I find that, once the 'fever' starts nothing really stops it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am 47. About 8 years ago after another bad relationship I decided I needed to be alone for a while. I was finally getting good treatment and I knew that I was not better enough to be with anyone. It was just going to be for a year. After a year I made a lot of progress but not quite enough so I said 1 more year. After that passed I was happy, feeling mostly in control of my major symptoms, and I liked not being on the relationship roller coaster so I thought 1 more year. 3 years should be good.  At about 3.5 years a friend said that I had given up and I should get out there again. They were pretty persistent about it and they are to the best of their ability a very good friend advice wise. So off I went to plenty of fish and  found mine. 

&#x200B;

I was so happy. Everything seemed to be so good. Sure he had problems but it was nothing I could not handle/fix (yeah I missed that red flag). Due to the nature of our relationship there were rules including honesty and in a good state of mind I was happy with them.  I was totally open about my history, my BPD, my trauma and my triggers. He even respected that I felt we needed to wait to have sex because it was almost a new ""first time"". He began to get depressed after about 6 months and he kept telling me things would get better. It was X thing or Y thing. He became hyper critical and asked more and more of me.  

&#x200B;

At 11 months I had reached breaking point and when I confronted him he brought up something that had happened 6 months before where I had ""embarrassed"" him by getting too drunk. I own that I did drink far more than anyone should, more than I ever usually did. I was frat boy drunk.  We had talked about it the next day and I explained that I thought what happened was every time someone did shots people would bring me one because I was hostessing, sometimes multiple people. I had not been aware enough and that I was sorry.  We did not fight. He expressed his disappointment in what I felt was a constructive way and we took a few days of not communicating. Then things moved on happily.

&#x200B;

No, they had not. He told me that basically he had been treating me worse and worse to get me to break up with him since that night. He just could not get over it. I was destroyed. Not only because he had been so utterly callous and deceptive, not only because apparently everyone in his friend group knew and I had been humiliating myself by talking about how well things were going and how much I loved him... but at times he also literally held my life in his hands. I had trusted him to care for me in these situations because I thought he loved me and in reality my life was in the hands of someone who felt pity, shame, and resentment towards me. For 6 months I trusted someone twice my size and strength to keep me from harm he could do if his intentions were not honorable and consensual. I still struggle with that last point but have otherwise let go of him and the relationship. 

&#x200B;

It really was one of the least destructive relationship endings because I had a sense of ME to return to and go to therapy about where I had made ineffective decisions. I decided that I was done with relationships. I just did not have the skills to make effective decisions and see things as what they are. It is 5 years this month. I cannot have casual sex so I don't have it at all and I am 95% totally okay with that. I love the feeling of freedom I have and knowing that I am in control of my happiness. I have a small village of chosen family that support and love me.

&#x200B;

So now that I have vomited up my spleen all over this post... here is the TL;DR  


I have chosen to remain single with great results but I don't know anyone else like me who would possibly understand the challenges and pains that this choice can have sometimes.

I've made my partner cut off most of his family because I get so possessive and jealous. I want to just let him go and stop hurting him, but I'm afraid that the process of breaking up will cause me to get nasty and hurt him more. I also have a problem with hurting myself when I get really upset. I smash my head against walls or punch myself in the face and I've even given myself a concussion in the past. It makes trying to break up even scarier. I don't know what to do anymore. He's treated me so well and he's very trustworthy. The only times he has lied to me is about seeing or talking to family members I didn't want him to. I have very severe abandonment issues and the thought of losing him makes me a completely different person. I go into a survival mode of manipulation and panic to make him stay in my life. I feel like an awful person.

It’s been a year and a half since my last attempt that took me to the hospital. Since May, i haven’t had any even close to attempts where someone stopped me. This happened to me last year where i got bad because of all the flashbacks. I’ve been doing a lot of things to occupy my mind since then, and I’ve been actually stable. It feels like I’m going in a downward slope again. I see everyone posting to social media about it (i deleted twitter and deleted the apps for Snapchat, Instagram, and facebook) and it’s extremely triggering. Not because i don’t think people need to hear about suicide awareness, but selfishly enough, it’s extremely triggering to me as like i said, it gives me flashbacks or even just remembering bad memories.

I know it’s all jumbled and i don’t even know what I’m asking, but as someone with BPD, it makes me not want to reach out to my friends that have attempted, in fear of triggering them as well :/

Im just looking for advice on how to handle this but to also make others more aware. It’s hard because it’s such a triggering subject. But maybe I’m just not ready. 

I wrote a wordpress about my attempt and being diagnosed with BPD and that helped and i really hope it brought more awareness to what BPD is like, not for everyone, but for me.

I hate confrontation and I detest gossip and drama - it makes me uneasy and like people will talk about me the second they get a chance to if they talk about others to me... which is usually accurate - Only I feel like most people don’t struggle as badly as I do with this. Most people can roll it off and say “fuck it, I won’t deal with that kind of person”, but for me, it destroys me when a friend doesn’t approve of things that I do or takes it upon themselves to provide advice I never asked for under the guise of being helpful. It fucks with my psyche deeply and I can’t fathom why. I see these same women “hold” other women to high standards and I simply am incapable of meeting those standards.

I have some bitchy women in my social group that I never realized were self-centered and dramatic, I’ve seen them as the “hustler” type and admired their strengths and ability to get shit done, but when I “step out of line” or don’t keep up with their social demands I feel disregarded and unworthy.

Part of me has found validation in these types of friends because I see them as “winners” and being associated with them helps me feel like I am succeeding since I view them as successful and admire their confidence and determination, but, maybe I just hate myself and feel like I deserve the pain of being treated poorly because I am a loser in comparison.

When I hear ""splitting"" described by people, they usually use the example of jumping from loving someone to hating someone in an instant - it's black and white. But I've never experienced splitting in this way...

I think a lot about the cognitive distortions (thinking traps) that I fall into and I definitely see myself splitting in a situational sense (""this is going great, I'm in a great mood"" to one little bad thing happening so instantly ""everything is completely ruined""). I also experience splitting in a sense in my perception of how people perceive me. I read into the tiniest details. I go from thinking that I am on the same page as someone else (they like me, tolerate me, aren't annoyed with me yet, etc.) to thinking that they absolutely hate me. This is something that I think drives people away from me. I ask people if they hate me all of the time! To them, I'm sure it is out of the blue, but to me, this constantly plagues my mind. I think that one little thing I say or do changes how others see me and it is hard to think that no everything is my fault. Logically, I should know that they don't hate me for an awkward goodbye at the end of the day, for example, but to me, that is where my mind jumps to - there is no in-between.

So situationally and perception-wise, I feel like can ""split"" so quickly and it distorts my thinking and can ruin relationships. But I don't think that I go from loving to hating people like that. Is this really ""splitting"" or something else entirely?",10,0

 I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2016 when I was 16 years old even though I started to see a psychiatrist when I was 13. Back then they thought I had major depressive disorder. I made my first suicide attempt just a days after I celebrated my 13th birthday. 

 Years passed, and I started to get more and more depressive. Went from an excellent student who only had excellent grades to pass with the bare minimum. My relationships were awful, I tended to swtich between the love-hate feeling we all know. 

 The thing is, I was really lost. I really thought that by now (I'm currently 20) I would be dead to suicide. I'm not even able to recall how many times I have tried to kill myself because there were so many times I tried it that I lost the count. I couldn't keep a relationship with a friend, a lover, my family started to avoid me. The only one who sticked with me till the end was my mother.

 Last year, I met a new therapist. That was the first-time I did DBT. Some tools given were useful, some were not. I think that it depends on the type of person you are. However, after 4-6 weeks I started to meditate, my life changed for real, I'm not exaggerating. 

 I was highly volatile in the past, and I started not only to be able to control my anger, but to control my mood swings (my mood started to be more stable by time), I started to be the kid I was in terms of school, I started to gain more control of my relationships. But the thing I noticed the most, was my well-being. I always tended to be a highly depressive person, but after meditation it kind of disappeared. There are tons of research papers who talk about this. I finally started to feel hope after years of being in hell. 

 Adding the tools I learnt in DBT, I started to be a highly functional person. I think this is one of these times where you can say ""I'm really glad I didn't kill myself"", because I wouldn't be able to experience life like I'm living it right now. 

 Nothing is wonderful, but what I try to say is that there is hope for everyone. If I could get out of hell you can also get out of there. I swear that if it wasn't for meditation, my therapist and my mother I wouldn't be here writing this. 

 There are a lot of audios on SoundCloud or YouTube who can help you to meditate if your concentration spam is as awful as mine is. I promise you that it's only going to be for the better.

I have an amazing psychiatrist, who took the time to explain why I don't process threats the same way ""normal"" people do.  No one in my 42 years has explained it to me as effectively as he did.  I have known I had BPD for MANY years and even completed about 1.5 years of DBT and have had stints of 1 and even 2.5 years of sobriety in the past 15 years.  So I have been sober since 9/15/19, and the sobriety itself made it so my symptoms just like flew straight to the surface.  So the only effective treatment my doctor said would work is DBT, CBT, other support groups (like AA or NA), and intense therapy.  I am already really incorporating my mindfulness skills and I have my AA literature here in the hospital to read.  Bad news is that I live with an untreated dry drunk; my husband.  He doesn't quite understand what I am going through, but last night at visiting my doctor gave us an informative video to watch.  I'm sure it helped but not 100%.  I mean it's taken me like 20 years to get a grasp on what's happening, he's not going to get it in one day.  We have been together 5 years, and I've been hospitalized three times in that span.  I've been sober half of our relationship/marriage and not the other half.  

Some things that help me are sleeping well, eating a balanced low carb diet, exercise, attending AA meetings and working the steps, going to my therapy and groups, and making friends in recovery who are supportive and positive.

&#x200B;

So my questions to this group are:  What has worked for you as far as treatment/therapies?  What has helped your family members to understand what you are going through?  How have they best supported you?

It was like being slapped in the face with my own face. I tick every single fucking box. Even the way it presents in children. I’m obviously going to talk to my doctor, I have an upcoming appointment. 

It would explain why I hyper focus on a single person and keep everyone else at a few arm-lengths. It explains why sometimes I lose my ability to comprehend the world around me and regress. It explains the self harm starting in childhood. The obsessions with drugs, sex, and whatever new hobby I thought would complete me. The intense paranoia and unshakable delusions. Losing my temper at something so small and coming to 20 minutes later to my poor husband hiding under his ‘shame hole’ blanket. Always flying off to a new thing without thought or bothering to tell anyone. Being willing to do Anything, ANYTHING to maintain my primary relationship, sometimes at the cost of years of misery. The monolithic anxiety, the lying, the reckless spending, the mildly stalker-like behavior, the feeling of utter disconnection from myself. Feeling everything or nothing. 

I’m illuminated, and utterly heartbroken. I’ve always known there was something off, but nothing fit. Not sustained enough to be Depression, not patterned like Bipolar. 

Can anyone tell me their story of how they figured it out or were diagnosed? I’d love to hear them. My husband is deployed right now so I have to do this bit alone.",15,0

So let’s forward up until 1.5 years ago when I finally found the courage to walk away from 10 year emotionally and physically abusive marriage.  


I guess you could say I started to notice similar experiences in my relationships and remember just praying and crying behind my steering wheel begging anyone listening above the clouds to give me healthy relationships , please, please I remember saying “ I have no idea what they are or how they feel like “

I 100% accept my part also and my own lack of self acceptance , self validation and self love . I know I’m not a victim anymore But it’s like I love been  playing detective and finally found I’ve found  the killer , as I traced the roots of my pain back it stemmed to - my narcissistic mother &amp; the narc infested environments I surrounded myself in .  

I’ll be 41 in 2 months and I’m finally learning I will need to be the one to self soothe myself , self parent myself , to calm me down to hug me to assure me to accept me.  

Yesterday evening  I ended up in a sugar coma , I’ve not done it in like 5 days but i relapsed and ate several slices of  cake even though I know it’s a form of self hurt &amp; sabotages my goals . But when I’m in the pain I can’t see logic I just feel everything so much , so intense , so overwhelmingly.

I did it because a flying monkey from my Narc mother’s side of the Family invited me to a family event at her house, interesting though she’s not reached out for almost 2 years , I wonder if it’s because my narc grandmother &amp; narc mother told her they couldn’t get in contact with me ( yes they’ve been blocked ), so is there anyway she perhaps called and invited me round so she  could see how I was doing -maybe- you know checking in to report back  ?? I wonder , oh I wonder !!

 For years I’ve always just thought I’m the weird outsider , of course I am , I’ve spend years googling and searching for my diagnosis , the reason , why I am the strange one . I know it’s because I am the Empath one , the free spirited one, maybe ? the outsider one  , the ADHD one , the religious one , the I had an abortion once one , the Highly Sensitive one , the Idealist one  , the big mouth one , the inappropriate one , the 12 stepper one , the entrepreneur minded one, the confident and very sure of herself one , the can’t make her mind up one , the traveler one , the scared to go out the home  one , the inconsistent one , the panic attack one, the one who was left from age 5- 14 with boys her own age , in her room  , those boys would play around with her breasts and vagina and well, you know , that slutty one , she’s the one who didn’t stop them so she (that’s I ) must have wanted it too right ? I was that one . 

The No parents around to check in on her  one , the daydreaming in her head all the time one , the goofy , very silly one - the up-tight , can’t even crack a smaller one , the one everyone loves a comedian one? The  exploring and discovering all the time one , the  focused one , the promiscuous one ,  the don’t even so much as look at me with lust one , the dramatic one , the extremely artistic one , the spontaneous one , the over-thinking  one , the deep one , the nervous  one , the girl who was mocked one.

The consistently from elementary to high school bullied one , The systematic and organized one , the messy one, remember after all she’s ADHD , the not of this world one , the Myers-Briggs  introverted one , or is she (me, I) the  extroverted one  , whoooo, coz she (me, I)  sure  do change quickly , you know , one of them ones .

The  220 pound plus woman  who’s only  5 foot 5 one or the ohhh my God you’ve lost so much weight one , you have such nice curvy shape lady  , your the thin waist, cute shaped  one, wow the one that makes the heads turn one.


Is she the age 9 traumatized by her fathers death in prison one ? After all he was denied mediation and died in prison. The grieving girl who never got to go to her dads funeral one , when she was 9 years old.  safety  felt like it left for good when her dad left - because her mom didn’t like him much anyways  and when her auntie came to take her the funeral they were late for it , so (she , I) miss my dads funeral and come to think of it I’m still over 30 years later pissed off about that one.

The one who has daddy issues because her dad was the only person who she felt ever 100% wanted to validate her , wanted her and wanted to take her away from her narc mom. Or is she/me/I  just into her, daydreaming mode, you know the  ones who like making up stories, what a shame , one of those ones .

Is she the huge attention seeking one , full of rage one ? Or the super shy stay in the corner  one -  I don’t want to be seen one ?  The binge eating one, come on binge eating and ADHD Go together so you should really expect that one ! Or is she/ / me / I the appear to eat healthy in front of others one ? The emotionally erratic and unstable  one or the numb one , the ages so zen and contained one ? The self loving one or the (she , I ) is/am full of self hate one ?

maybe Shes the into the  same sex stuff one , because once upon a time  when she was in her 20’s - so could she be the gay one ? Is that why ( she , I  ) feel like this ?  The it’s all about me right now one? Or the have it your way one ?

Is it the your such a good mom one ? Who do you do it all one ? Your so positive one ? The I gong wanna be here one ? The mood swing one ? The motivational speaker one ? 


The conservative one ? The philosophical , live and let live one ? The minimalist one ? Or the get rich or die trying one ? Ok I’m officially done trying to figure out which one , if I’m exhausted just writing all my ones I wonder how the people trying to firm a relationship with me feel .. well that means I can’t be the narcissistic one I thought I was - because I care about how tired they feel , right ? Or am I wrong ? 

Maybe , just maybe then they are right  it’s all just me - my fault - right ?

Maybe this is why I CANT get close to anyone because who can get close to all this stuff , I wouldn’t want anyone close to this stuff this is why I may devalue you or jus cut you off or just decide I’m off , or I’ll hurt you because it’s better you don’t love me , why do you think you love me anyway . Do you know what I am ? Are you even able to handle anyone of those ones? 

Of course you won’t be able to handle allOf those people , I mean all of those ones - it’s just too much for any - one! Right ? Or am I wrong will you still hold on and not try to save me , control me, shame me but see the real me , the real one ? 

Actually it’s ok I realize I need to be the one to do that first , I can’t look for you to love my ones because I’m working on making one big whole one based on those ones - I am not ashamed of any of those ones because I am learning that that’s a whole lot of one - person , so I guess that makes me technically a mysterious and interesting one ? Maybe ? I mean do you think I am interesting ? 

Why do I care what you think anyways ?

The truth is I  was plagued with unhealthy family dynamics from scratch - yes most families are unhealthy you say , I know , but why did mine leave me doubting myself so much? 

I would wake up in the middle of the night from a  nightmare and run to my moms room so she could tell me it’s ok , but she wasn’t there , in fact no one was there ,  she was out , she was gone , but she didn’t say she was leaving ... 

All that was left was the darkness literally it was dark and I was alone I was just a small child . 

When she came home that morning she was happy because she went to a night club , But i was scared I was alone , I had a nightmare , why didn’t she say she was going ? 

That’s when I had to learn to live in an imagination , to always tell myself how great everything was and how great it could be , this was my survival skill and it worked for a while I mean , I always smiled . 

I learned that my love needed to be earned , if I could say yes enough , be nice enough , look good enough , give enough or better still be needed enough I could be something .

Flashbacks of being hit in the head for looking the wrong way, for sighing , for writing too dark with a pencil , well it feels I was hit or had things thrown at me for breathing too hard. 

Now I know my mom made it very clear she didn’t like my father and she made it very clear I was just like him , I looked like him spoke like him. As I matter  of fact I may  as well have been him (in her eyes).

She would remind me how much better and firmer her butt was than mine was when she was my age ... why did I always have a feeling she was competing with me ?

Ummmm there were years of  the continuous subtle put downs from my family for  seeming “spaced out or unorganized” , but I wonder why I was like that? 

I mean if no one else could see why I was like that and it was because I was  actually in pain feeling constantly unlovable, unworthy , scared about which mom would walk through the door , the happy or angry one ?  

So I  developed a kind of child like, non threatening , not too intimidating , not too much of a bother for you personality , this way I wouldn’t stand out too much or make others feel incompetent , uneasy or inconvenienced by me. 

I always looked to make people laugh that was a safe way to be accepted also if I was  always smiling people liked that , agreeable, well people like that - whoever you need me to be , I can/ could  be that for  you . The thing is I don’t think the body likes that , go-figure. As I turned 40 one of those ones had reached its limit and decided it wanted to find a self loving one and make it my main - one!

So here I am today sharing my story in a long post but it’s a form of awareness I have gratitude for because I don’t judge or pity myself but I am pleased to say I have a huge amount of patience and compassion for myself . 

Today I realized its time to stop it - yes I have a lot of issues but a lot of it all stems from me not feeling loved and my narcissistic mother so .... 

today I sent the following message and I am in tears, because it was brave and bold and concrete and frightening but it was the line in the sand I can’t keep blaming others I must take responsibility I’m about to be 41 and I can change my life , I can live the rest of it without self harming , I can learn and develop safe boundaries , I can do it even if I am waiting for therapy I am not a victim any more I have choices I can make good ones . 

The text wrote 

“ Thank You for the invite Auntie  ? I have made a decision to cut ties with all of my biological family . 

There is No hate or ill  thoughts , just very spiritually and mentally necessary for my future well-being”



So this is it I feel happy, sad, scared, frightened , bold , strong , courageous and full of grief  all at the same time - however in someways I’m finally glad - there was no drama , no asking a group , calling a fiend , no religious reasons , just me, validating something I’ve deep down always felt but repressed - I never wanted to seem rude to express it or to hurt anyone .

It no longer matters , self love , self parenting , self care is now my own choose . Even when I fail I am not a failure I am a human who must have compassion for herself , who choose to surround herself with people who want to see me do better and I choose to be ok with not people pleasing , because its ok for me to self validate . With the exception of my children.

 I say the last sentence with a giggle &amp;amp; smile  (always helped me in the past cope in hard times ) - so here’s the last sentence , I hope you can see the rainbow , hug and smile at the end, just like I do. 

I am no longer responsible for overthinking how I can be liked and loved by others which then makes me start worrying about everyone else’s reactions . There reactions ? Damn It! It’s enough work just working on my own!",45,0

My BPD has my brain running at 1000 miles an hour always, and it’s rarely to my advantage. I’m constantly stressing or worrying about something, obsessing over past social interactions (from that day or 10 years ago, I seem to find a new interaction to agonize over every day), or imagining different scenarios. When it comes to relaxing & especially sleeping, I feel like I can’t physically turn it off to where my body can wind down. So, I turned 21 this year, and am lucky to live in a legal state. I smoke every day at this point because I am finding that being high helps in that it “numbs” or “blurs” my overactive mental state. It makes it possible for me to rest, mentally & physically, and gives me a feeling of relief. Almost like I’m taking a break from my brain & body for a while. I know marijuana isn’t “addictive” necessarily, but I’m wondering if it’s caused any issues in particular for those with BPD. I’m terrified of it becoming a crutch that I can’t function without.

It's not skin off his back because he doesnt need me in the office and he knows I work after hours anyway. But he maintains his a authority this way I think.

Just stay away from people and not try to ever build a meaningful connection. When I do it is very few and far between but they never last because I ruin the relationships.

I internalize everything which I'm aware is not good. Then I just isolate myself from the world as much as humanly possible. I feel alone, with or without people around.

Ive got this friend. my mind will blow minuscule interactions with him into something much much more than what they are, basically making a mountain out of a molehill at every chance it can get. I can't tell if I have a crush on him or not, but he uses isolation as a coping mechanism often. when he's isolating himself from everyone \[including me\], I feel majorly shut out and I get anxious and upset more easily. 

sometimes I feel as if im worth nothing if I don't have his approval \[even if its with something as small as an opinion on music\] , and if he's upset with me it feels like the entire world is falling down around me. I fear that ill do something that could be interpreted as manipulative or harmful in order to get his attention, instead of taking the time to understand that he's allowed to struggle too. my problem is that I don't realise im being irrational or thinking of manipulative things until im out of the headspace, which is leading me to be more anxious ill hurt him by acting impulsively. 

how do I force myself to review my thoughts constantly? is cutting him off the best decision, so neither of us get hurt? 

please don't leave any negative comments. im looking for genuine advice on how to prevent any bad situations.",29,0

828,Impulsive Sex and Self Harm,26,dligwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/dligwd/impulsive_sex_and_self_harm/,22,1571753427.0,"-Self-harm here is less about the physical impact and more about the psychological impact.-

Here we go:

I feel as though I have zero control at this point. I’m intensely stressed out and was recently dropped by my therapist, combined with all sorts of personal life fires that in can’t seem to put fully out. So my sexual impulses have been out of control. 

It was brought to my attention, by one of the only mental health professionals that I felt listened to me, that it was possibly an addictive behavior to replace my self-harming tendencies (ironically, this conversation was had while I was being treated in the ER for slicing my arm open). Because my relationship with sex is complicated, mostly it feeds into my self-loathing and fuels my irrational belief that I deserve to suffer and die, it was suggested that I’m using it to “self-harm” in a psychological sense (and somewhat physical given  what “kinks” I’m prone to engage in to really hit the self abasement sweet spot). 

Every time anything starts to stress me out or life seems to take a frustrating turn, I’m consumed by my desire to have sex. 

I wouldn’t describe this as a state or arousal or being “horny”. It’s much more a... compulsion. It’s like when you’re really thirsty and it’s hot and you start drinking water, but you want to relieve that uncomfortable, horrid thirst so bad that you chug the water and accidentally almost choke yourself. And even after you take those gasping breaths in between coughing the water back up, you just start chugging again because you want relief from the thirst so bad you aren’t thinking and you can’t slow down. A part of my brain tries to convince me it’ll be cathartic in some way, but the majority of my brain understands the need to just feed this compulsive behavior. 

It’s not the sex that I want, but the distraction from everything going on, and the weird satisfaction of validating the feeling that I’m a terrible, worthless person who deserves to be used and degraded until the day-to-day self can align to the god-I-fucking-hate-myself-self, and I can just finally fuck all the way off and die. 

The confusion grows as there’s absolutely a part of me, or a version of me, my day-to-day, my 9-5 (or 7:30-4:30 really) self that feels fine. I consider myself hardworking and worthwhile and professionally competent. I recognize the positive contributions I make to the lives of the people I interact with, from family and friends to my students. I value my life and my well-being, but I don’t understand all of my feelings and actions contrary. I don’t understand the compulsive sex, the impulses to self-harm, that frustrating internal struggle between who I think I mostly am or are trying to be, and all my thoughts and actions otherwise. 

I don’t even know if this is BPD or my own flavor of dysfunction, but I wonder if anyone else feels this way? Or has any suggestions for coping while I search for a new therapist? 

TLDR; Sex has become this compulsory behavior to replace/fulfill my need for self-harm, furthering the conflicting versions of myself as a worthwhile human being or a worthless, debased human trash bin.

&#x200B;

I've known my FP since I was about 19- So, 2014/2015 respectively. At one time, I split on her, before I even knew what BPD was, and ended up vilifying her in my head and was able to live fine without her...until Autumn of last year, when we reconnected. And, just like that, all of these feelings are back.

&#x200B;

I know being someone's FP is a lot. I'm very mentally aware of that fact. I try not to be smothering, because I know how she is. Distant, unavailable- You know, *totally perfect* for someone with a disorder like this. Two days ago, she had essentially told me she doesn't care much for me, because she has her own FP. And it sent me into a spiral so bad, that the ability to feel anything genuine is just gone. Speaking to her today, she only contacted me when a local beauty shop was going to receive something she was interested in, and I offered to grab and send her a few things.  Anything else vaguely brought up about how I was feeling was dismissed.

&#x200B;

I want to detach. Because I know if I continue on like this, it's going to be bad.I don't mind her as a friend. Maybe just a distant one, but at least still a friend.I can't have her as a FP anymore, because it's killing me. I was already sent to the hospital for an alcohol mishap last year, over an incident that involved her. And now, I'm three bottles in within October *alone.*

&#x200B;

Suggestions would be great.Someone to talk to me about this intimately would also be great.

&#x200B;

Thank you guys for helping, if you see this and respond. I'm not on Reddit often, but I'll try to be more attentive now that I've actually posted something.

&#x200B;

Edit: After 0 sleep, it's nice to wake up to a few suggestions. I'm not sure entirely what DBT is - since my doctor never advised me into it- but I don't have insurance, and if it's something medical, I really might not be able to seek that treatment, since I'm not financially in a place to do any kind of therapy just yet.

837,I’m so done buying tickets to this rollercoaster ride. Pulling the “triggers” and saying goodbye.,12,dnokxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/dnokxm/im_so_done_buying_tickets_to_this_rollercoaster/,6,1572149624.0,"TLDR: had a great vacation, then immediately severely depressed/ suicidal called into work the next 2 days/ back to self by middle of 1st day/ embarrassed. 

How does this happen? 

For me...? Triggers?!.

Here’s how my week went.
MON- OFF for a minor surgery
TUES- OFF to recover. 
WED- worked 6.5 hrs and called into managers office, they literally spewed lies, and I didn’t argue back because it would have reinforced the reason for me getting in “trouble”. Left feeling like shit and started driving as I was on vacation the next to days. I was highly suicidal on the car ride for the first 4 hrs, upset, took a lot for me to eventually calm down. 
THUR- enjoyed the hell out of the first vacation day. 
FRI- another great day, started the 8 hr drive home, also started to become irritable. Had completely lost it from the triggers from the person I had vacationed with. Was upset/ suicidal/ didn’t know how I could make it through work the next day. 
SAT- text boss at 4am to say I couldn’t make it in due to an emergency. Exhausted/ hopeless/ body hurts/ chest hurts/ crying/ sad/ depressed/ low energy /mourned x boyfriend and the love I miss that I felt from him in a way I’d felt from no other/decided to read then decided to muster up all energy to walk while the sun was rising/ came home ran an errand (still no response from boss- whatever). Came home/ took a nap/ read/read/ migrated to couch where I could feel the suns warmth/ read and took time to focus on truths and essentially how I was feeling. Started to feel better/ so I started doing small tasks/ putting away vacation bag/ rest/ prep dinner in crockpot/ rest/read/ clean up. 

Before I knew it I was back to feeling myself. The teetering swayed back into the gold and I was golden once again. Did an awesome painting/ stacked rocks/ wrote poetry. - all these things I do on a normal basis as it is. Finished up dinner, which came out fantastic. Feeling back in love with life. 

ALSO...CAN’T take a bath because of the surgery I had Monday and baths are a MAJOR SELF CARE/SELF SOOTHE. Also, am not drinking or smoking weed/ cigs so that option I didn’t indulge either ( 17 days sober!!) 

Could go to work tomorrow, but definitely won’t. I let go of the guilt and shame I was feeling for calling in. I’ve been employed 9 months I called in once 3 months after I was hired because I had gone home sick (throwing up at work) and the 2nd time was in July and I had a DRs note from my THERAPIST, because I knew I couldn’t work at that time and was starting to cross boundaries with clients as far as personal life info. So I called in 2 days then as well. A DRs note excuses the absence. Which brings us to today... where life felt so unbearable and I felt absolutely stupid about how much fun I’d had on vacation only to end up in such emotional turmoil. I was googling crisis centers that could have seen me, I was making valid attempts to save myself. Maybe more so my job with another DRs note. I gave up. I’ll get one from my therapist Monday when I see her. 
Does anyone else have these sorts of episodes? 

I’m highly embarrassed that I jumped the gun and called in for 2 days after such an amazing trip. I feel work is going to have a hard time understanding AS I AM HAVING A HARD time understanding this. But hey I guess that’s mental health and I know if I’d had gone to work today, I would have been the bitch they’ve accused me of being as I was not in the mood for a single thing, including life. 

I conjured up so many lies , preparing myself for when I return. I can’t do it though. I hate lies. I’ll just again hand over the DRs note from my therapist excusing me for the weekend without going into detail. 

I’m doing my best to just not beat myself up over it all. And relish in that fact that I’m better and need to make changes with certain people in an effort to avoid the triggers that get me THAT FAR GONE. Hence the title- pulling (goodbye) the “triggers” (people/environments that don’t serve me) - from my life. So I no longer buy a ticket to this rollercoaster ride.",12,0

She has BPD but was never diagnosed.  I endured decades of anger and rage, blaming, and emotional abuse.  She never saw any reason why treating me this way was a problem.  One of the many final straws was her turning her rage onto my oldest son.  He’s just like me, which I think made him a good target for her anger.  She had blown up at dinner out at a restaurant one night.  It was a fundraiser for the kids school. Lots of families there. Yelling at my oldest in public, not caring what anyone thought. Some minor homework thing, he was in 5th grade at the time.  I managed to calm things down enough to pay the check and drive home.  Ex and youngest went inside and I talked to my oldest in the car.  He asked me how I could deal with her treating me the way she did.  Fuck.  I told him some bullshit and it killed me inside.  That was one of the last straws. If she’s not caught up in her BPD she is a great mom and I’d not be half the dad I am except for many of the positive things I learned from her.  She would always, 100% of the time, be the one to start arguments.   They would go on for hours and keep cycling even after things were resolved.  Punching walls, throwing things, slamming doors.  Exiting the car and walking away in the middle of nowhere. Before kids. After kids.  Yelling and insulting me in front of the kids. Never interested in me or giving me attention or intimacy.  I’m tall, fit, handsome, funny, and smart.  

Now we are divorced.  50/50 custody.  I am so unbearably happy.  Throughout the divorce process and now afterward I am reminded about all the reasons why we got divorced. I don’t know how I took her shit for so long.  Rather I do know: I’m an extremely positive happy person, optimistic, and generally think the best of people.  Every day was and is a new day and a chance for something better.  I’m with someone now that I couldn’t even imagine existed before.  Caring, compassionate, reasonable, understanding, and so much more.  

This is a shitty vent post, for sure.  But I want to encourage those of you with BPD that are working on your issues.   Keep working on yourself.  Let those around you know that they matter to you.  Tell them you are sorry when you blow up. Tell them you know it’s you and you are sorry.   I can’t imagine what it’s like to be you, but I lived with and loved someone with BPD for 20 years.  She never cared enough to seek treatment or try to change her behavior.  Maybe she kinda tried a couple times but she resented the effort and I could see her being utterly fake and it looked like she was a bottle of shaken up soda ready to pop.  

TL/DR: divorced someone I’d spent 20 years with that had BPD.   It was hell, but not always.  Those of you with BPD: keep working on yourself, you are very brave.",14,0

I live in my childhood home with my father, his wife, her adult daughter and her 2 children. I have struggled being on disability and can't afford to live elsewhere.  I was physically and emotionally abused by my father and biological mother, in this house. His wife has been evil and has been since day 1 twenty something years ago. She told people her goal was to get rid of us so she could have all of my dads attention and money. 

We have now all been living here for 10 years.  I have been in treatment and am doing relatively well but my step mother and step sister have both become drunks. My step mother is every night and step sister binges for weeks and months at a time then stops.  My father has been in utter denial and just goes to his mancave and tunes it out literally cranking the volume on his tv. I however am stuck upstairs in the middle of it all. Life has not been good to those kids at all.... While not diagnosed or in treatment both their mother and grandmother have some type of cluster B. Their father walked out and in for a little while but disappeared, literally, about 5 years ago. He has never paid a dime for support. 

Last night things got particularly bad as both their mother and grandmother were totally wasted and had been since 4pm. By the time they asked me to come home I got here and it was a shit show. Their mother was just hurling insults at them... it was awful. Luckily my step mother passed out shortly after I got home. But it was relentless and my nephew finally lost his temper, and rightfully so, and told her to go the fuck away and not talk to him until she was sober. She tried to say she wasn't drunk and at that point my niece had run into my room and was in my lap sobbing. I looked at her and told my step sister she was as bad as her mother and go the fuck to bed. So she did... and today my niece and nephew went to their guidance counselors which they had agreed to do and I told them I supported them fully. So, I am in the grocery store and I get a phone call and it is my nephews guidance counselor looking to confirm things and she let me know that Child services would be calling and that my nephew did not feel safe coming home and he would be sleeping at a friends. We did not know what was going on with my niece because they did not call but I rushed home and went to my father and calmly told him what had happened (if I show any emotion he freaks!) just so he is not blindsided because he is so deeply in denial it is disgusting. He looked at me like I was telling him the moon was really made of cheese!!  He actually said, ""As long as it doesn't interfere my life, whatever.""

I got a call from child services to once again confirm the kids story.

Their mother has been sending them hurtful and guilt tripping texts, my nephew wouldn't come home so he is at his friends house. My niece and I have been checking in and now it turns out their mother is refusing to come home tonight and my stepmother is being evil mean to her- but she is sober she threw all the booze away or hid it somewhere, idk. 

\-- breaking news step mother has left to ""go to the store"" and their mother is here.

&#x200B;

So needless to say. While I am making myself totally available to advocate for and protect them I am getting triggered left and right and have been for years. This is finally all exploding and if I get caught in the middle of it my father will blame me or my step mother will do god knows what, she is not well!! I have all of my own fears crashing into my head while still trying to be there for them. 

My therapist has been on medical leave since July and was supposed to be back by now so I have been without therapy since then and I am using every fucking tool in my toolbox to stay grounded I am starting to lose it! Right now my step sister is in the room with my niece with the door closed and I am terrified of what she is saying. My step mother has already been stoking her fears about how what she did was wrong and that her mom will get in trouble. Telling her that she might not be able to be a parent anymore etc. 

I feel so helpless and trapped and this house is just built on the remains of an insane asylum for horrific parents!!!

I've been reading every article, watched every Youtube video looked at every top post on this sub and spent the entire day yesterday thinking about why I think so much. 

I woke up this Morning as I do every Saturday and declared This is going to be the Best Day Ever, im going to get so much done im going to feel amazing im going to......STOP...right there I realized what I was doing. I was already on a High for no reason, I was Mentally making things Amazing BEFORE there was any evidence that it would be...you know what happens when you do that...Disappointment. 

So when the day turns out Average like most days are, I get sad, I start the slippery slope of I suck, why cant I get all the things done that I said I would...oh I kno because im a lazy piece of shit. Cue me laying in bed all day gettin nothing done.

I do this with my Days, I do this with my relationships, I do this with my personality. I do this with my life. I put everything on this ridiculously High pedastal and when it turns out...average im thrown into a self induced pit of despair. 

Lets try this for the next few days, lets assume that everything is just Average. Your day wont be Amazing, Your spouse isnt the Picture of Perfection, You dont have the Best Personality. Its just Average until proven Amazing. This way of thinking feels less ""Polar"" less extreme it feels more...Normal.

Recently I quit my job for a year where my pay was good, I had friends there, it was easy to do but then I got a call from the company I applied a few months ago. I got invited as a seasonal employee but eventually I negotiated to be a full timer. I got hired. My training was intense but went well. Right now I am actually working while still in my probation and it felt very good until today. I had some questions about my pay because they were vague about how much I was actually going to earn each month. Eventually it seemed to be a lot less than I thought & lower than my previous job... I can basically pay my (high) rent, my other fixed expenses like health care etc. I asked what can I do if I need a bit more salary? they said well you need to find another job while laughing. Which seems very rude?? I mean it can sound rude if you ask for more pay but I am 24, live on my own with high rent so I need a decent pay to get around. I got so sad because I thought my pay would be a bit better and I got to have more fun and it felt like I was lying to myself and imagining it was all so good.

After I left work I cried the way home. I have borderline so right now I feel very low and it feels so hard to get out of... I feel like I made a mistake changing jobs, moving to a new city for that job. My relationship is okay but there are some stuff that are very hard to deal with for me and I fear he will leave me if i'm not fast enough with dealing with it. So I don't really know what to do... I feel like I can't do anything well. It is tough seeing my parents who live in a different city, in my weekends I am too tired to do anything, my birthday was almost a month ago and I did not even celebrate it with my family, I feel like it is so hard to be with me, I feel like I am not good enough, I don't really have friends since I find it hard to trust anyone and I am too tired and afraid to be disappointed.

I really tried to find ways to convince myself that I’m not a horrible, evil person and all my terrible actions came from a place of fear and stemmed from indescribable, incomprehensible pain. Not to excuse myself by any means, but more so to learn to go on with my life without hating every piece of my being to the point of wanting to tear my skin off and burning what all I have left so as to tarnish the remains of my body beyond any sort of recognition to reflect what’s truly inside.


But then I watched someone’s depiction of what it’s really like to be in relation with me and my awful emotionally abusive behaviors (before I learned that there is a diagnosis for it and a treatment). I thought there was hope for some sense of redemption, and that perhaps I could contribute something positive to humanity through my future career, but that all died when I imagined again how horrifying it must have been to live with me. The last night I lived with the love of my life, it felt like watching an angel cry, and knowing it was all my fault. That pure, innocent, precious soul, tainted by the products of my own misery. The same soul that chose to forgive me over and over again, and though he is too traumatized to love me romantically ever again, he still finds ways to love me platonically on a daily basis and constantly urges me to go on as apparently I bring him joy (no matter how much I beg him to leave as he is my codependent and will only find TRUE joy without me in his life).


Hatred and loathing can’t even begin to describe what I feel about myself. No one ever said that evil people can’t regret their actions, and I believe the accuracy of that description for my case stems from the fact that the consequences of my horrifying actions caused real, permanent trauma in people I thought I genuinely loved and cared for.


Pls forgive me for the splurge of thoughts, I don’t feel like organizing but feel free to ask me appropriate questions as needed.",24,0

I’m tired of trying to love myself or at least not hate myself. I’m tired of how I behave in social situations to seek attentions (causing more self hatred). I’m tired of taking enough pills to have the energy and capacity to make a living and feel like somewhat of a person. I’m tired of feeling disconnected with everything and everyone. I’m tired of not telling the truth about my problems even when I desperately want to because I’m afraid of being misunderstood or ignored. I’m tired of trying. Life with BPD’s symptoms is exhausting, infuriating, painful, and deeply confusing all at the same time. I question everything and always have. Nothing seems certain about the essence  of who I am (if anyone/anything at all) - especially after this diagnosis. In therapy, I have to force myself to express what I really feel because of how instinctively I adapt to environments in order to hide my sense of brokenness.

My best friend of ten years has recently been diagnosed with BPD. Since I've known her, she's always been either extremely emotional or detached, weird and sudden mood changes (usually anger) that disappears in a few hours and everything is fine again, and a huge fear of abandonment. in August she was officially diagnosed after her first major depressive episode.
She moved to a different state a few years ago to further her career and I'm so proud of everything she's accomplished and how hard she's worked. But I've felt a distance for a while and a strain on a relationship that has brought me so much joy for so long and it's breaking my heart to feel like I'm losing her. But her behavior, even after diagnosis, in my mind, is still destructive. I'm in recovery from being diagnosed as bipolar II a few years ago and need stability. And it angered me beyond belief when she said she didn't want to pursue the therapy designed just for BPD. 
I haven't talked to her for a while, last we spoke I tried to explain that I've been in a weird place (meds finally working, my defense mechanisms are being torn apart and I'm very raw right now) and that's why I've been distant. And she understood, took time to ask me more about being BP and I felt better. Then heard nothing for weeks. But now she's done with a huge project to further her career and all of a sudden I'm back in the picture and she needs to see me, but I don't feel safe being around her erratic behaviors when I'm still battling mine. 

I don't want to lose her. She's a kind and loving person who has made a wonderful impact in my life, but it's getting harder and harder and I'm at a loss. I want to be there for her because I know how scary what she's going through is, but I don't know how to do it without making me regress. I feel horrible and selfish for thinking maybe this relationship has gotten unhealthy for me when clearly she's suffering from this disorder and needs support and stable friends more than anything. 
Can anyone help me better understand what she's going through so maybe I can learn more and be there for her, but also protect myself? 
tl:dr best friend is borderline, I'm bipolar, her actions are hurting me during my recovery, but I don't want to lose someone I love so much because she's suffering and it's hard for me to handle because of my own issues.",14,0

In a few of these arguments, I was called “selfish”. Especially with my sisters, as I’ll be headed home next week to see them for the first time since either attempt. 

There are so many layers to calling a person selfish for something like suicide. Selfish implies that I had no consideration for others, that I was doing it for my own  personal gain or pleasure. 

There is nothing to gain from suicide and no pleasure other than the relief from the immense pain I feel. I did think of my friends and family every day that I struggled, and came closer and closer to the conclusion that they would be better off without my volatile nature and tumultuous personality. I got to a point where I recognized that while it would initially hurt, time heals all wounds, and their lives would move on, regardless. In fact, they would be better off without me. 

I got to a point where I looked at myself in the mirror and a stranger looked back.

I watched her bleed until the sudden nausea and chills from the blood loss slammed me back into my body early enough for me to get help. 

Suicide is not selfish when you’re so lost that you can’t find your way back and your mental state is such that it seems like the only reasonable option left. 

I refuse to be shamed and made feel guilty for what happened. I’m doing the best that I can, given what I’m working with and against. I’m sorry that I hurt people I care about and caused them worry and pain, but I refuse to be called selfish for my state of mind and doing what I felt was my best and only option. 

I’m not selfish for trying to kill myself.",24,0

I had briefly set my shoes atop of something as I locked the office door to leave, well I forgot them and by the time I got to my car and back upstairs (3-5 mins) someone decided to throw my shoes 3 ft from where they’d been set. 

I asked a couple of the coworkers if they’d seen who did it and they said “NO”. Since I was on my way out I didn’t want to fiddle with the drama and just left. I was very upset though. 

...very upset is an understatement and I had to really utilize self control to not indulge in drinking or smoking as a way to rid the feelings. I was making attempts at just letting them go and not being upset over such a silly situation, until I burned my hand REALLY bad from something I was cooking. At that point I “abandoned ship” left everything as it was and retreated to my room to cry. The burn hurt, yes but it was also the fact that I was hurting. In an effort to ensure my son (who knew I was upset as I had discussed the situation with him when I got home and was just making strides to be strong) didn’t hear me, I went inside my closet, closed the door, sat on the floor with the boxof tissues and cried, and cried and cried. 

As I cried I explored why I was upset, and for me it boiled down to a few things- feeling disrespected , and how I often times have allowed others to treat me like shit, not standing up for myself. How I have no one to hold me/ comfort me as I cried. No one but myself to encourage that it would be better, I felt lonely, and it served as a reminder of my childhood, I had to soothe myself. This then turned into how I feel about my dad and his lack of presence in my life, and how that’s made me feel unworthy and unloved, “not enough”. How I can’t call my mom because unless it’s about her she has nothing to say and my feelings have never been and never will be validated by her. 

So in the end, it wasn’t the shoes being thrown. It was that the situation as a whole was/is a trigger for a slew of other things I am still contending with as an adult. Sure my dads not around, and my mom never was emotionally, they still aren’t and won’t be. And a part of me feels that I realized yesterday, my dad will probably never be a part of my life the way I’ve ever longer for. Nor will my mother ever be the mother that validates and loves me without condition. That I am alone and have had to take care of myself emotionally in so many way, and that it is tiring and I long for someone to love me unconditionally. I need to be that person, that loves me unconditionally.",33,0

So I’ve not long got out of a 2.5 year relationship (longest I’ve ever had.) I’ve got three children and they all have different dads (please don’t judge) 

I’ve been through the mill with this one that actually made me look through the internet and BPD explanations metaphorically slapped me in the face. so much so that I looked at videos, case studies and wrote down how I fit in to the assessment criteria. I’ve struggled with depression my whole life and it’s come to light that I am also severely anxious. 

I went to my GP and the next month I had a call back from a mental health screener who told me I had traits and put me forward for emotional management workshops. However this month I have received a letter for a mental health assessment. I’m super nervous because I tried to tell my mom and she dismissed it outright by saying there’s nothing wrong with me . I do feel as though I have this though and so must the NHS if I’m getting an appointment! 

I’m either deeply in love or I’m wanting the person to get the hell out of my life. No in between. I’ve picked my skin till it bleeds for as long as I can remember. I seem to pick a friend and stick to them and I’ve never been a fan of meeting their friends; this ha been something I’ve had to work on. I don’t have a sense of image. Instead I stick to whomever I’m associating with and do what they do. I’m use to being abandoned now. I’m raising 3 kids on my own like I have done since I became a parent. 

I’m 31 now nearly 32 and I feel like... empty inside. I feel like such a bad person so much that if anyone wanted a relationship with me I would discourage them so I don’t end up hurting me. Every relationship I’ve had I become disappointed and slowly back off over time.

I'm not diagnosed, but tests show that I am highly likely to have BPD.  Because it was never financially feasible for me to see a shrink, I've had to discover coping skills on my own.  The only thing I think I still struggle with is my empathy paradox.  I can logically think my way through things when it comes to strangers, but if I even get the sense that a close friend or loved one is being dishonest with me, I will either cut them out entirely or hold them under intense scrutiny.  I believe this stems from every romantic relationship I have had (which I dont enter into easily;takes a lot for me to trust somebody in that aspect) I ended up being cheated on, including a marriage.  The affair left me feeling completely used, like she was merely just using me for a place to live ( we dated, we broke up because she admittedly cheated on me, I made the mistake of taking her back when it didnt work out with the other guy, soon after she tells me she is getting evicted from her home, very soon after she starts talking about how we should get married, we get married and its like a switch was flipped inside of her allowing her to become chronically emotionally abusive, my first b-day rolls around that we are husband and wife and she ditches me to go bowling with friends from work but I'm not invited which I respond with if thats what you wanna do then dont come back tonight, she gets dropped off by an ex bf 2 days later and insists nothing happened with insults added in, soon after constantly accuses me of cheating, eventually go back to the usual of her relentlessly insulting me for no given reason, because she didnt drive she had us move to a new apartment for the sole purpose that it was within walking distance to the grocery store that she worked at which she ended up refusing to walk and made me drive her to and from work, she suddenly has friends at this new job when before she was complaining about them, once again I am not allowed to meet them, after some calm questioning from me she eventually admits that she doesnt have friends at work and that she made a new guy friend but I am not allowed to meet him, she insists that she isnt cheating and then the accusations that I am cheating on her start up again, by this point I am pretty sure I am just being used, I devise a test by making myself appear completely useless to her, I calmly tell her that her new ""friend"" can give her rides to and from work now and that I wont be doing so, during this time I secretly line up a new job and quit my other one, when she sees me not going to work, I tell her I got fired, the next day I wake up to a dear John and havent seen or heard from her since. Well that was a run on sentence lol. Not part of my question, just explaining my trust issues and why I think I struggle with the empathy paradox). I used to get angry easily, but luckily I've outgrown that.  Last time I exploded on somebody was due to being frustrated because the ex called me while I was at work saying my computer did something that she couldnt get to stop and was asking me how to stop it.  I talked her through a few steps and it wasnt working so I told her to just end the process in task manager (something I know for a fact she knows how to do) and she refused saying that it would make me angry. I insisted that it wouldnt because it wouldnt and tried explaining that I have to do it all the time with that program, but she wouldnt do it.  Long story short, I was trying to perform my job and give her instructions that she asked for but she refused to perform and I blew my top; ended up driving home in a rage and ended the process myself and just walked out the door without saying a word because I knew that it wouldnt be a good idea for me to talk to her at that moment.  That was probably about 3-4 years ago now, and I really havent been angry since. Sure, there are things that irk me every now and then, but I've taught myself techniques to cope with it.  Honesty is a big key to that.  I now have no qualms telling somebody they need to stop something because they are pissing me off and why it is.  In the rare case that isnt an option, I just leave so I can cool off.   

The empathy paradox is a struggle though, because having friends helps me fill that empty void that I have never been able to completely fill; I dont think I have ever been content in life.  I dont do well socially, mainly because I get negative vibes from people.  I dont necessarily think they are aimed at me personally, as in those people are actively out to get me, but I do look at those people as fake or as someone with a larger potential to screw me over.  I guess what I am getting at is that its hard to make new friends.  At the same time, with current friends, I can and will cut them out of my life if I slightly feel they are lying to me.  In those cases, I have found some coping skills to help. I dont carry a cell phone anymore ( cant come up with reasons somebody isnt responding to a call/text if I cant call ), I ditched FB for similar reasons; I suppose I just eliminated triggers that I identified rather than learned techniques to cope.  

I've been rambling for a while now, but, I feel like the emptiness feeling stems from all of that.  I havent self harmed for over a decade now, but when I did, it was simply to feel something, because pain and anger was all that I could feel back then.  I was also plagued with suicidal thoughts.  Eventually, I decided to travel, and travel I did.  I worked at 2 national parks.  They were both isolated, serene, and peaceful.  I still felt empty, but thoughts of suicide were gone.  I started drinking A LOT.  Drinking myself into oblivion only concealed the emptiness inside of me. Luckily, I had enough logic and will power to stop drinking the first time I noticed I was withdrawing.  I rarely drink now, but I smoke cannabis.  I smoke cannabis because the suicidal thoughts came back during that last year of marriage and only got worse after.  Just something about it the drug can melt away the suicidal thoughts, but still allow me to logically explore reasons why I might be feeling that way.  I have been able to drastically reduce how long my suicidal thoughts can last (Worked my way down from like a month of pretty crippling thoughts down to about a week, and sometimes a couple days in more recent cases) by using cannabis to melt away the thoughts while also allowing me to reflect.  Many times I never find an answer, but the drug is still beneficial because I still havent gone down to Mexico to get a euthanasia drug from the a pet store.  

BUT, the emptiness, the darkness, the void is always there, never fully satiated, always wanting more, yet never defining what it craves. 

Even with professional treatment, does the emptiness ever go away?

""Behold [my] personal disaster (BPD breakdowns)""

I feel so...deep.
Unconditional and full.
A heat in my belly that warms a city.
Too much. 
Truly, this is too much.
Tears that never dry.
Anger that is always high.
And when happiness comes it seems my smile is always too wide. 
Hovering in the middle seems like a dream.
To be what others seem to be.
Calm,
Chill,
Normal.
It seems so peaceful to me.

Pushing down.
Down
Down
Down.

For no reason. 
Not one.

I hate you today, my love.
I hate you so much.
But tomorrow, my love,
Tomorrow you mean the moon, 
The stars,
And the sun.
I love you so much it hurts.
No really,
This physically hurts. 
And I'm screaming at you.
And throwing Libbey Glass at our walls.
This anger is so intense.
Seeing red is no longer a term that seems so outrageous to me.
Drowning in my anxiety.
I can't breathe. 
Tossing and turning under weighted blankets.
Watching the minutes go by like days.
My chest feels like it's closing in on me.
You seem so calm and it's worrying me.
And my status of mental stability just crumbled to the ground. 

I catch my breath.
Dry my tears,
Lower my voice,
Relax my cheek bones.

Deep emotions experienced like waves trapped in a bottle.
Daily.
Every day.
I feel them.
And I can't take this emotional whirlwind any longer. 

Capture my borderline state and throw it down a mountain side. 
I'm ready for the sun rise on a new day filled with nothing but normal. 
I want to feel neutral.

I want to feel calm.

As the child of a mother who has severe Borderline organisation, but also has NPD and very high social functioning which in combination contribute to some very abusive behaviour, I’ve probably flown close to the sun in terms of developing the disorder but awareness is everything, and I got help because of it. 
Everyone on this subreddit is aware of the disorder playing a role in their lives, and furthermore you share about it. I don’t see what more we can possibly be asking from one another than that we be brave and speak up when there is a problem, particularly if you’re being told that you are the problem. 
My mother will never ever admit to anything of the kind, she will never get help, that’s what hurts most. If you’re reading this on this sub then I don’t believe you are the ‘spawn of Satan’ heard about in tales of BPD abuse, not anymore at least. 
You shouldn’t have to feel as if you’re the scourge of humanity and there’s no hope for you. Keep going to therapy, keep engaging in dialogue about it, and being genuine about it. If you’re doing that, I don’t think it matters what ‘condition’ you have, you’re an alright one in my book.

I told him about my bipolar but was afraid that if I talked about my bpd he would leave me.

He was actually understanding, and supportive. Even though he doesn't understand how I could have such negative views about myself. I was able to explain my dislocation when he talks about his ex. I get extremely jealous and just become an empty shell with a smile. He reassured me that he wouldn't leave me for her and that he really does love me. He wants to be with me. 

We even talked about moving in together. I'm just so happy right now and I'm hoping that I can keep this momentum going. When I'm with him any negative thoughts I have about myself goes away. Even when I'm away from him the urge to do anything bad is minimized and I can talk myself out of it. I'm hoping that when I'm away from him I don't have any more illogical thoughts about our relationship. 

Though as I write this out it sounds like I'm kind of dependent on him for my self worth. Damnit! Well baby steps I guess. 🙁",15,0

You don't have to read this.

This year I realized alot about myself. I have noticed I am a liar not to other people but to myself. I lie to myself that I am fine, I'm okay, I've acknowledged what happened, and I'm going to take getting better seriously. The worst thing I've done to myself is tell these lies constantly in my head. 

I have a really bad relationship with men, probably because my dad left me and my mom to live homeless in canada while he went back to our country. I always thought he was going to come back but when I meet him at age 16 and he told me he wouldnt come back because it's too cold, really changed my aspect of him. It really shows just how worhtless I am to him, if your own dad wouldnt love you then why would anyone else. This year he has gotten married and wanted me to congratulate him. This is one of the things that truely did upset me this year.

Speaking about the men in my life, I was raped back in 2018 by a guy who claimed he loved me. I later on went ahead and started dating this man, while I spent the rest of my 2018 and beginning of 2019 being raped by him. I loved him though, and I know he just has a high sex drive so maybe I should just accept the fact he hurts me everytime we have sex. As well as uses it against me when I dont want to, claiming I dont love him if I dont have sex with him.

Other than the first time he raped me this other time was really traumatizing which actually affected me more than the first time. I got drunk really drunk (blacked out) and all I can remember is me puking, crying, and begging him to get off me. The next day he bragged about how good he fucked me. I tried to talk about it but, he said he would just stop having sex with me, because I'm saying things that could get him in trouble. 

2019 summer I was sexually molested by my client a 78 year old man, I was his care giver after a tragic car accident and spent my whole summer taking care of him. He told me I was like a daughter to him, then invited me over because he needed help. I didnt leave or run I probably gave him signals  and made him think it was okay to rub me, touch me, and kiss me in inappropriate places. I just stood there in shock that at 23 I am still having my power taken away from me. No matter where I go rather its work, home, or just walking through a mall. 

On my birthday my uncle tried to commit suicide, I spent my birthday driving around the city hoping to find him and that he didnt follow through with his plans. I found him, dragged him to my car and then spent the night with him trying to make sure he was in a safe heas space. My uncle is 50 years old, we both suffer from mental illness and I hope to god I'm not like him when I'm 50.

In april the same bf who raped me constantly, embarrassed me in public by dragging me out of the club and physically assaulted me in public. No body cared because I didnt tell anyone. I packed his stuff out of my apartment and dropped it off at his dads house so he can live there. I couldnt deal with him anymore always bringing me down, talking about my family, and forcing me to have really traumatizing sex. But he loves me and cant see himself with anyone else but me, so he wont leave me alone. 

I got into a car accident this decemeber, I lost my car which resulted me being late in all my Bill's. He hit my car and now I have to suffer the consequences. 

My now ex bf (the one that raped me) broke into my home after stealing $100 from my bank card. He said how I'm always playing victim and continued to belittle me and call me names. He spent this whole year making sure everyone knows that I'm the bad guy and hes innocent. Now im afraid in my own home and I cant even move out. I wake up scared that he could be in my home, i have nightmares of me hiding from him while he breaks in looking for me and then forcing me to have sex with him.

 I am currently having sex for money when I dont need to, i work a great job as a teacher. I just dont want to built anymore sexual relationships that dont provide me any gain, since all sex has been for me is taking away my power and making me feel worthless.

This was my 2019 and every single innocent I blame myself and make excuses for peoples behavior because that's what I was raised to do. Everything was always my fault as a child and now I'm afraid I'm stuck in this narrative. I grew up with a narcissistic mother who was addicted to drugs and an alcoholic. She even blamed me for her having a heart attack and then confined in me she regrets having me as a daughter (I was the worst). She thought she was going to die so she confessed her true feelings about me I'm assuming. She made it pretty clear that I ruined her life and I was the worst daughter out of the 3. Meanwhile I was the only one there for her when she got really sick. That was when my panic attacks started in 2017, the very next day after she told her own child that I am the reason why she has a horrible life, and if she dies it's my fault. 

I have relapse in cutting myself as well as was trying to attempt suicide for each incident. I am depressed and now to embarrassed to talk about it because I cant stop saying how this is my fault.

I've spent the past 15 years of my life on a constant emotional roller coaster, and man, surprisingly the diagnosis makes me feel way less crazy. I'm so exhausted from life and it feels so good to kind of ... Have a direction towards stability now. 

After a wee bit of a psychotic break back in August, I finally decided to take my mental health into my own hands. 5 months of constant doctor and therapist appointments, trying to figure out if I'm bipolar or if I have ptsd or what, they've finally settled on borderline and ... Yeah, that me. To a fucking T. 

I took psychology in school and work in mental health, and I've always identified with people with BPD. The reason why I never thought I had it before was that, I didn't think I had abandonment issues because I'm kind of a cold bitch sometimes and keep people a distant because I dont trust them. Then about a month ago I realized, ""holy fuck I'm so terrified of abandonment that I've self destructed every single relationship I've ever had to avoid them abandoning me first."" And then I started going through my life and realized all the erratic, frantic efforts I've made to stop people leaving me in the past. 

Like, literally hugging an exboyfriend's legs to try to stop him from leaving, AFTER I BROKE UP WITH HIM FIRST AND HE DECIDED TO MOVE ON??? Or spending every day of my life going back and forth between ""I'm a really good person."" To ""You are Satan's child you evil bitch."" 

I'm so relieved right now. Ten dollars says four hours later I'll be crying in my pillow about it but heyyyy, for now I'll enjoy the high.

I haven't sought therapy yet or started meds, I'm perscribed 150mg venlafaxin for depression, not bpd, and afraid to start that in fear of mania. 

I've been struggling with my thoughts and feelings for just about all my life, as a kid I had the overactive imagination, being too nice to people, getting hurt as a result and being made a subject of ridicule. I think the US has played a big part in my expectations of how life will be and the experince of facing reality and how shitty people and the world is has been dissapointing and a rough ride for me, i still can't really deal with it or accept it. 

Anyways I have always wondered 'why I'm so different', 'nobody understands me', and 'everybody is on another wavelength' etc. I mean, I know people are just people and everyone is pretty much the same but you know what I mean, it's easier for us to read people, spaces and situations, and I think easier for ur to be ourselves sincerely and maybe the most obvious trait, our sensitivity of emotion.
Have you ever had people assume you're using drugs because your personality is so wild or colorful? Infuriating, isn't it?
I mean, on a side note, I don't self-harm, but I HAVE tried every drug in the book, on multiple occasions but I've had incredible self control and luck in never getting dependent (except for caffeine, thc and alcohol, the latter which I am done with, thank the universe.).

Anyway, dealing with existence and these feelings can be pretty goddamn tough, and I was surprised when I stumbled upon an article of Diogenes of Sinope, a funny guy from ancient Greece, and from there ended up at Camus and other absurdist philosophers. Now I'm not huge on philosophy, and have only scratched the surface, but the amazing thing is I can almost see myself when reading some of this shit, and it gives weird comfort and motivation to know other people in history have also felt the same, and that this shit IS manageable and CAN be enjoyed. And kind of has to be to be able to go on.

Hve you had similar experiences? Other methods of keeping busy like music? Please share 😊 also, any other kind of advice for coping is welcome in this thread! 😊

Thanks in advance, it means a lot to me to be able to ask and discuss this with other people ❤️


Edit: I have to drop this Kierkegaard quote here just to be a prentious asshole, but bear with me, I think many of us can relate: 

""... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible – no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other – no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself – with all the tortures of hell, if so it must be.""

I feel horrible for the way I treated her, the way I continue to treat her, and angry at myself for being me... 

The worst part is that I know all these feelings (while all feelings are valid), are kind of irrational. I understand that I shouldn't expect one person to check all the companion boxes in my life. Of course she needs her own time alone, or with other friends. But none of these ""rational"" thoughts in my head make the pain in my chest, or the feeling of wanting to pull my hair out, or the anger I have at myself go away. 

And for some reason, I feel like my BPD symptoms peak during Chicago winters.",11,0

before this i got into an argument with my husband. i feel so bad for him. i don't deserve him. we were cuddling in bed and i felt like he wasn't 100% focused on me, like maybe 80%. it made me so angry. i accused him of being bored and told him to leave and go do something else if he doesn't love me enough to cuddle, along with some other not so nice comments. it's completely insane. i was so angry and now i'm just embarrassed and feel so guilty and remorseful, like always. stuff like this happens every day throughout the day.  

but the people that talk about being in a relationship with someone with bpd, i think they're completely right. maybe not about everyone. but all my relationships have been like this.. i get so angry so easy. i throw tantrums like a toddler. i cry over nothing. i cannot control myself. i fall in love too fast, become obsessed. i try not to, i know it's bad and not normal. but i wish i could describe what it's like to obsessively fall in love with someone so easily. it's all-consuming, amazing, terrifying. i want to be loved so badly i'd do almost anything to feel loved and cared for.  

i'm guilty of manipulating my exes, using self-harm as manipulation, using disordered eating behaviours as manipulation, lying, cheating. never suicide threats... i managed not to go that far. i tell people lies about myself and events that happened and my exes that are so terrible but they feel true when i say them. it's like the only way to feel like i properly expressed the truth (the reality i went through) is to change details and heighten them because otherwise no one would understand. i hope this makes sense.  

we had bad childhoods yeah but this doesn't excuse the horrible things i've done to people i loved. my mother was cold and distant, my father sexually abused me, i was raped and beaten as a kid, i never felt safe or loved, but so what. i don't have to act like this but it feels out of my control. what's worse is also it's definitely gotten harder to deal with as i've gotten older, the symptoms. everything is hopeless. you would think ""don't be a horrible person"" would be easier but no, of course not.",25,0

Individuals with BPD aren’t animals, for Christ’s sake. We’re humans with a disease. It’s either genetic or because we suffered some trauma in early childhood. Either way, we can’t control it. Just like people with type 1 diabetes or paralysis can’t help their afflictions. If you have BPD you SUFFER. We all want to get better but not everyone has a loving family for support or thousands of dollars for therapy and various medications. My point is, everyone has a choice.

looking back at my love of ""debating"" with people about anything and everything, i see how i love to take it to the point where theyre asking me to stop and im defending myself saying im not trying to argue i just like having conversations about topics that have more than one side. and i push and i push until they get mad or upset and i dont care at all and its fun for me to do that, and i cant stand when people do that to me. but the whole time im sitting there telling people that if someone is arguing with you over petty things and yelling at you, theyre toxic and you need to get away from them. so am i toxic?

i push people away over dumb reasons (for being human and making the same mistakes that i do) and i dont even explain myself to them i just apologize (truthfully, i just use my skills at playing up to their emotions and my memories with them and wanting to be close with them again and because i want them to not be so far away and i am sorry for being mean and distant) and they always forgive me and we go back to being close like nothing ever happened. but when someone else does that to them, i say thats not okay because they deserve a reason and they shouldnt be treated like that and that the other person is toxic. so am i toxic?

i become (i want to say slightly, i dont think im truly obsessive) obsessive about what someone is doing if theyre not giving me their full attention and answering me back or if their response seems a little off and i get paranoid that they hate me and i feel the need to check their social media for signs that they hate me. but if anyone else did that to them, id tell them that person was crazy and they need to cut them off. they dont need to have that around them. i try to ignore that part of me because i know its not healthy, but i cant help that its there. i cant help but give in sometimes and wonder if they hate me. im good at not confronting them, i only slip up sometimes. but i know it makes me a bad person to obsess like that.

looking at these behaviors has made me feel disgusted with myself and made me feel like i dont know myself even more now. except the difference now is that i know whatever there is to me is that its bad, im a bad person and i dont like whatever there is about me. i thought i was good, i thought i did everything right. i thought i treated people the right way and i was kind and i thought i could at least say that about myself but now im not so sure.

so i think i might be the toxic person everyone was warned about. and i dont know how to fix it.",34,0

I know she and our mutual friends will never empathize with me. I know they will always see me as a villain with impure intentions, that toxic friend that should be discarded like trash.

I’ve been having a lot of episodes like this lately and I feel like I’m absolutely losing my mind.  Especially because now that I understand that my behavior is a problem, because after these episodes I feel embarrassed and guilty, and like an overall fuckup. I guess my main question here is what do people do to calm themselves and avoid getting keyed up when faced with triggers? It feels like when these events happen someone else entirely is in control and I just have to sit back and watch. I know the things I’m saying are wrong the second they come out of my mouth but I keep saying them anyway.

Do you know the struggle? Feeling trapped and suffocated just by being alive and being you? Knowing that you were going to be disappointed and disappoint other people? 

I cant have a meaningful connection with anybody. Ever. Not just due to the fact of being magnetized towards toxic people, but knowing that I could evolve someone into a toxic person. How do you live knowing what we do? Thinking how we do? Feeling, & also lack thereof, how we do? Statistics state that 80-90% of people diagnosed with BPD will commit suicide. It scared me because I completely get why they would want to. 

My therapist said you can never cure it. You can adjust to cope better, and realize when youre splitting or disassociating. That maybe it can go into remission. How cruel is that? That unlike ""normal"" people, we have to try harder to cope with the realities of the world. Obviously as children we saw the world as it truly was, and didnt have anybody to rely on. And that follows us for as long as we live.

1149,I broke up with my soul mate three times. I’m a monster.,16,eyuqd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/eyuqd1/i_broke_up_with_my_soul_mate_three_times_im_a/,1,1580841714.0,"I feel hopelessly confused and lost and heartbroken over my last relationship -- even though I ended it, more than once. I cannot understand why I feel so attached to, obsessed with, and so much love for someone I've decided multiple times wasn't right for me. I think about him constantly and can barely go a few hours without memories of him or wanting to contact him, even though it’s been months now. 

Backstory: In 2017, I had been in a long term relationship for almost four years, and we decided to open up our relationship. We had a very stable friendship and home life, but our sexual chemistry was waning. I began seeing someone who I fell madly in love with--someone who had a wildly different lifestyle from me, and who offered less security, but intense passion and a feeling of aliveness and compatibility that was exhilarating. A few months into this, I left my long term partner. On the face of it, I said we had grown apart, and that's what I told myself, too. Deep down I knew I was leaving him on the prayer of being with my secondary partner, who I'll call Nyx. A month after that, Nyx did choose to be with me monogamously, and we began a relationship that lasted a year and a half. We slowly and rockily worked towards having a more stable and secure relationship, but the dynamic seemed unfair to me at times. I was constantly asking him to show up for me, and while he did try, it didn't feel like enough to meet the needs of a full relationship. The passion was always there, but the day to day life stuff was difficult. It didn't seem like our lives would ever sync up the way I desperately wanted. Our second summer together, I ended things. After that, he had an epiphany and wanted to do things differently. We talked all summer into fall and slept together, but I felt distrustful of his efforts and in truth pushed him away and held him at arm's length emotionally. I think when we were together it felt like he had all this power--and I think in the reversal I got a little too into the role of being the detached one, the one who is asked of, the one who decides. I felt numb towards him and couldn’t understand why. We separated again for a month. He was angry with me, he started dating other people. I fell apart, I missed him endlessly and went insane in my longing for him. I begged him to take me back. We reunited, on his condition that we get serious about all the things we had discussed before we ever broke up the first time--moving in together, syncing up schedules, making personal decisions together. As we got into that work, it felt like a lot of arguments cropped up from our different approaches to home, work, and health. Then, my best friend of 10 years--my cat--unexpectedly died in a traumatic manner. Devastated doesn't even cover what I felt that day. I told Nyx a few minutes after I found out (over the phone) and he, without my permission, went and picked up her body from the vet an hour after she died. I lost my mind--we had never discussed this, it felt like a massive overstep into my boundaries as we had never lived together yet, she was my cat, and I wanted her cremated, not buried. I was so angry and felt so violated that it got all tangled up in my grief. I couldn't speak to him for three days. My friends encouraged me to end the relationship. I sent him a breakup text (which I cringe even typing, I feel so guilty for doing it that way) and then blocked him on everything. We haven't spoken in almost three months. I have thought so much about everything that happened and I think I see now that he was just trying to help and maybe I overreacted. I feel so much guilt and shame and pain for shutting him out and feel like I have ended my chance at the only love that ever made me feel truly alive. Everything about him was so special to me, and yet I had no patience for the ways in which we were different. I think about him every day and miss him like a searing pain inside. I know that it would be cruel to contact him again because a. I broke up with him 3 times and b. I don't think I have grown enough as a person to be in another relationship, and if I did contact him I would just throw myself down and plead to be with him. I feel like I am a broken, selfish, terrible person for breaking up with someone I loved/love so many times.",16,0

I was being so good in the beginning by not being so bombarding over text-but the more my suspicions rose about him and if he actually liked me, I kept connecting how long he took to respond, of if he didn’t initiate contact one day-as a sign that he wasn’t interested in me. So of course, I started to get really antsy all the time for him to text me first, and when he would fall off the face of the earth-especially in the evenings-I would freak out. There also would be times where we had talked about hanging out a particular day, and then he would ignore my texts all day-meanwhile I’m pretty much blowing up his phone. Then decide to tell me at the end of the day, that he’s just too tired to hangout. I didn’t know if I was overreacting this whole time, but part of me sees it as almost malicious that I’ve told him before how anxious I feel when he goes MIA when we have clearly made plans to hangout. Yet, he would do it anyways. Fast forward, I pretty much found out (using my own devices) that he had been going out and hooking up with other girls. Even though he had promised me on multiple occasions that I have nothing to worry about and that he doesn’t have the extra time nor interest in talking to anybody else. We even had the conversation that we were exclusive. But then when I caught him, he decides to say that I have a right to be mad but we aren’t dating. And that was a slap in the face. I’m not sure if I had been gaslighted this entire time, but this whole situation sucked a lot.

Update: he texted me last night (almost been a week since we’ve stopped talking) saying that he truly is sorry for what he did and that it’s been bothering him all week. What do I make of this?",38,0

I’m really good at never really connecting to anyone, keeping it at some level of superficiality while convincing myself (and the other person, usually) that it’s not superficial. 

But I’ve realized, as I’ve been doing work on myself, that I don’t trust anyone enough to allow for a meaningful connection. Though I can trust/connect to a partner enough to cause some instability on my end. It starts with suspicion that my partner doesn’t like me or is just with me because he feels bad, and this can turn extreme at times. I lash out, “test” my partners loyalty, etc, all while trying very hard to make it seem like I’m being reasonable and have good reasons to feel the way I do, because I can never directly share or show my true feelings.

My relationships always ends with me feeling resentful and disgusted in both my partner and myself. I’m the one who breaks up with them, and I never ask for them to get back together. So, I thought that without the presence of a “push and pull” dynamic, I wasn’t BPD. I don’t really fear people leaving, because I view all of my relationships as temporary and expect to be let down/let the other person down. 

However, I started to trust someone more than I have since I was perhaps I child: my current therapist. And things are getting crazy. I noticed later last year that I had to actively stop myself from reacting when he would say certain things that I took as him betraying me or pointing to abandonment. I fear he will discard me and am constantly looking to validate this. It’s getting worse, too. I had a full blown crisis over him last week where I almost lost my mind and almost threw a brick threw his office window.

I'm male, 37 and married with a little girl. 
I was only diagnosed at 25 after a life of very typical BPD symptoms. I was a victim of ongoing CSA but never really ""admitted it"" to myself. Once I acknowledged what happened and sought help, things got a lot better.
After a lot of trial and error I found the right combination of medications and therapy and now I'm living a pretty normal life despite my BPD.
I have a relatively successful career and have maintained long term relationships.
My life is never going to be easy. I'm always going to have symptoms. I'm always going to have rough patches. But if I can get things under control, knowing how bad I was for a long time, I know you all can too.

This is terrifying and yet liberating for me to post this. MY therapist said it might help me reflect on my moods from an outside perspective.  It's hard enough to tell myself that this is the person I am, but it really has been therapeutic to watch my panic attacks and discover things about myself that I can tweak in my next manic outburst.

Anyways, maybe you can help me by listening to me? Sometimes we all just need someone to listen. Happy Valentines Day, Reddit. I love you. 

Thanks. <3

I am very creative. This has been a blessing to my life as I am an entrepreneur and business ideas come easy to me. But my imagination seems to be so active that I get so lost in fantasy. I have been studying Buddhism to try and understand the effect of fantastical delusions leading to dissatisfaction. I haven’t always watched a lot of TV but have been recently because I am going through a period of depression and spending a lot of time inside. 
I’ve noticed I get so absorbed in TV shows it is like I am in them. I watched some of a series ‘You’ on Netflix and for about 2 weeks had make believe that I had my own stalker - this made me sure to live a very good life on show as I felt I was being watched - it felt like a justification to be hypomanic (I am also suspected Bipolar2). For these two weeks life felt super exciting and the fantasy lost its power and I crashed back down to reality - which is mundane. For those 2 weeks I  lived life meticulously as if a stranger was watching me - a stranger I’d made up in my imagination after watching the show. It felt like a delusion that I knew the real origin of?! 
I also noticed while I was on a 10 day silent meditation retreat how enourmas my fantasies were - nearly everyone I crossed paths with on retreat I had a fantasy about - I made up these stories of where they were from and how we were going to interact in the future...it led to a lot of disappointment at the end of the retreat and my reality was so boring compared to the fantasy I had been dreaming up. 
This seems to be a theme in my life. Everyone I meet, everything I do....reality is so mundane and boring compared to my imagined reality.

I want to learn how to be able to have a productive n forward focused conversation with them, but she responds negatively to absolutely everything I say or not even listening.

Through text I make sure to qoute exactly what they are saying and reply directly to their message but when they reply, it's as if I typed something totally different and insulting.

The same happens verbally, and lately I've started to say when they get aggressive to ""please repeat back to me what I said, because I don't understand how your reply relates."" and this worked at first but has now resulted in aggression, swearing and insults or straight up stonewalling.

I'm at my wits end.

Responding logically results in them flaring up in anger and responding emotionally helps no one.

I want a positive conversation with this person I love but they just warp everything I say.

Feeling empty. I don’t have it all days, but when I do it’s so, so horrible. Everything loses it’s name, it’s value. I feel like I am completely alone on the planet, complete detached from every one and everything around me. On these days I just want to disappear, be gone, go to sleep and never wake up again. It’s the biggest challenge to not take all of my pills, and just drift away into nothing.  😕

Also, I start to idolize myself. Look at myself all the time, start talking to myself, wishing I could just be together with myself. Maybe cause I hope it will make the emptiness go away. Sounds fucking crazy haha.

The smallest thing can trigger it, right now it’s the smell of the air outside. It’s changing, cause the weather is changing and the sun is shining. You’d think that makes someone happy! Not me, lol. 

I hope one day I can just be ok with it. Enjoy the silence. I just started DBT, I am feeling hopeful about that. But I already had an intense scheme therapy of 9 months, 5 days a week. Hope I’m not a lost cause. I’ll always keep trying to get better though. I learned a loooot about my bpd already, but some things are just so hard.

I can't stop thinking about Killing myself. I came really close to it last weekend, impulsively ran my car off the road while driving, went up on a sidewalk and almost smashed into an apartment building. I got put on a mental health transportation hold, they kept me for only 8 hours and let me go. I was surprised they let me go. The whole time I was in the psych ER I kept going back and forth between wanting to die and wanting to just get home to my dog. 
Like not really caring either way. Kind of like not caring in general if I were to die. 
Cliche but lately I've been fantasizing about getting coronavirus, what a way to go out. Wouldn't even have to have to feel guilt like if I did suicide.
Anyways, I do therapy, take meds, see a psych. I've done everything I can but nothing seems to be able to turn this ship around. Out of the blue, on beautiful sunny days when things seem to be looking up I'll start fantasizing about my death.
I was driving to a friend's house tonight and started wondering if I could hang myself with a dog leash. Or if jumping off a bridge into a river bear my place would do it or if just end up with a hundred broken bones.
I settled for taking a lighter and just holding it under my arm for a while until it burned. But I know the thoughts will come always come back.
I'm venting on Reddit because I've found telling people IRL just causes them to isolate me more and I'm afraid someone will have me locked up again in a psych unit. Been there, done that many times. It helps for a little while then the thoughts start again.

I am chronically paranoid that  one if my roommates is going to microwave all the medicine I take and ruin the pills. It terrifies me. But today a therapist asked me why I don't put my meds in a safe or lock them up it somewhere and I couldn't give a good answer. It's like part of me knows this is ridiculous.
And I've had this specific paranoia with ANYONE I live with. Sometimes if the pharmacist seems cranky I am also afraid she gave me fake pills, placebos. And I know that's not true but I worry about it still.
The newest fear I have is that one of my roommates, my new one could be hurting my dog when I'm not around. 
The therapist asked me if I have any reason to suspect this at all and I realized I don't. My dog seems to really like her my roommate, actually. She doesn't seem afraid of her. But the paranoia has been so strong I've been taking my dog with me in the car as often as I can so I don't have to leave her alone at home with my roommate. This is hard because she's a big dog and scratches the hell out of the interior of the car while we drive around. I never leave her alone in the car I just run the AC so we are both comfortable and I drive around the city with her because I need to get away from my roommates and I can't leave my dog there

I work at a grocery store as a cashier. I do enjoy my job a lot, but it’s easy for me to get incredibly anxious and feel like I can’t breathe. I have BPD, and I’ve been very open about it because I always hope that I can find a workplace that will be understanding. (Been here over a year so far) oh also I’m on my phone so I apologize if it’s all jumbled. 

Anyways, today in my city, I guess an announcement was made at some point in the afternoon that schools and offices and some other places would be shutting down for a few weeks for to the corona virus. I don’t really follow the news as often as I should, so when I got to work, I was not expecting it to look like the whole city was preparing for the apocalypse. 

I’m incredibly good at seeming happy and bubbly at work, and honestly all of my customers were very polite regardless of having lines going down the aisles and having to wait so long. But the anxiety started since I stepped foot in the store. When I finally had my lunch. I went into the change room feeling like I was fighting to breathe. I wanted to just go home and not turn back, but after the 30 minutes I went back and finished my shift. 

I had already decided that I would be calling in for my next shift, but one of my kind coworkers offered to take it, so I thought well that takes care of that. I thanked him and that also helped me to calm down a little bit and breathe easier. 

The rest of the shift went by quickly, and we ended up having to stay an hour later because of how unexpectedly busy we were. I didn’t mind though as there were no more customers, and organizing things calmed me down. The guy who was taking my shift tomorrow informed my manager before he left.  

As I was gathering all of the paperwork for the day, my manager yells over to me “why can’t you make your shift tomorrow ? You saw how busy it was today and I’ll need extra people. (She didn’t know that the service desk lady already took care of getting extra people for tomorrow) so I explained to her that I was very anxious all day and it had taken a lot out of me and my spot was filled. She was giving me attitude to begin with, but then she became really judgemental and demeaning and said “I had anxiety once and I challenged myself. That’s what you need to do. Public transportation made me anxious and I would make myself go in the bus and I got over it, it’s all mind over matter.” At this point I felt like I was going to have a mental breakdown and I reminded her that I don’t just have anxiety but BPD and I’m doing my best and things are not that simple. Ffs even if I did only have anxiety, telling someone that it’s mind over matter is such a bullshit asshole thing to do! This is the garbage that puts us down and makes us wonder why we can’t just be ‘normal’.

She leaves after that as we’re left still closing up and cleaning up. I bring the rest of the things to the office where the service lady is (who is an absolute sweetheart and definitely a mother figure to many at work) almost in tears saying “I have to quit I’m going to quit.” I then told her everything that my manager said to me and she told me not to pay attention to what manager said. She said that a lot of times she just lets her talk and doesn’t actually listen because manager is wrong and doesn’t understand the situation. I could feel my heart beating in my throat and was struggling to breathe. I told her that I’ve had people my whole life giving me the mind over matter thing and I can’t take it. I already feel like I’m insane and this makes me feel even more so. The service lady calls me sweetheart which is always comforting, and tells me that I got my shift covered and to stay home and relax. Manager can’t get mad about it since she took care of the extra people already.  Then she drove me home. 

I’m so sorry this is long and all over the place, I just needed to get it out. I’m still very anxious and contemplating never going back. Thank you for reading. 

Tl;dr: my store was very busy due to corona virus panic, which caused me to get very anxious. My manager told me to get over it because “mind over matter”",14,0

1280,BPD Management Strategies,67,fihw1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/fihw1b/bpd_management_strategies/,17,1584190324.0,"I posted this on /bpdmemes and someone said it might be useful to others. It was in response to a meme which basically said the more people know you, the less they like you. Or something like that. I also posted on /BPD, so apologies if some people have already seen. 

That is EXACTLY how I feel. I’ve felt that way for years. The more they know me, the more likely they are to have seen all the bad parts of me, the defective shameful bits. I have a few strategies I try and employ these days to deal with this.

1.	⁠Don’t spend too much time with any one person. Hard when you have a current favourite person though. But for everyone else, works quite well.
2.	⁠Stay away from people when being (my term) a bad borderline. So angry, irritable, rageful, negative, dyspeptic, dysphoric. This can cause other problems, because work is work, and some social events are seen as obligatory, like weddings etc. It is a balancing act. But I have destroyed friendships in one night through a rage episode. I’d rather be thought of as flaky.
3.	⁠Live by yourself. I know some are really uncomfortable with this, but I love it now. Does get lonely sometimes, but it is worth it. Get a pet, they are great. Borderlines are known to be fabulous with pets. They never complain we love them too much.
4.	⁠Be a fringe dweller, never be the centre of any group. Retain some mystery. No one needs to see the churning mess that is us. Sorry, but it’s true, it scares the crap out of most people. That way you can come and go, without bothering anyone, and just get close to the people that really interest you. Still, don’t overcommit and see them too much.
5.	⁠Be really mindful about sending any communications (email, text) when angry or distressed. These can also be a deal breaker. Write them without adding the recipient. Read. Read again. Save to notes on your phone. And only press send if absolutely necessary. This one, I generally only f*ck up when I have really bad PMT (2-3 days a month) OR when it is my favourite person, and they have shown some tolerance for this bad behaviour in the past. What also helps is reading them later. And being really grateful that you didn’t press send at the time.

I am sure that all sounds quite calculated, and it is. There are more, but these are the main ones. But, I have been dealing with this for 30 years now, and find this is what works for me. I do not do close very well, and really have learned to be OK with my own company. I still have intense fears of abandonment and rejection, but if you don’t get too close in the first place, then you can’t get anywhere near as hurt.",67,0

How should I deal with this? It's not like I can just hug a person out of nowhere. I'm alone... I feel so alone.. It's so messed up that such a simple thing as this, makes me feel like the worthless piece of shit and even makes me consider taking my life.. This seems so ridiculous but I really dig affection.

However as a male it's kinda hard to get any. I don't have affectionate nor supportive parents. I've been really neglected (and still am) through all my life. I've been a severe bullying victim. 

I also have extreme trust issues due to the fact that I've been cheated and abandoned by people too many times for me to count.. 

I don't have any friends, I don't have anyone to talk to, noone seems to care about me with the exception of my therapist (but I can't be with her everyday). 

I really want so much to be complimented, hugged, touched, kissed.. and don’t take it the wrong way, I'm not talking about sex! I just want to cuddle with someone or whatever.. you know what I mean! I can't even say this without feeling embarrassed.. 

I've been raised my whole life believing that I don't deserve anything.. and that, is causing all this awkwardness I'm feeling. How can I obtain anyone's sympathy and.. how should I even bring up this issue? 

I feel like such a creep when I write these things but it got to a really desperation point. Even someone punch me at this point would feel good, I feel so at without of touch with reality that sometimes I don't believe I'm really here in this world with anyone. 

I feel so jealous of other people it makes me so sad and angry the fact I don't know what I should do to in order to solve this! 

I'm so detached from everything that I don't even know how to bring this thing up that it's just like ""feeling hunger"", and that I can't seem to satisfy. This is so embarrassing.. I wish I didn't feel so humiliated by having all these feelings and for wanting love or affection. 

Do you realize how weird it is when a male like me looks at a girl and thinks ""her hands must feel so soft"" or ""a hug from her must feel like heaven""?. 

I'm only writing this on reddit because I know I'm in anonymity and noone will read this and know it's me because otherwise I would be too ashamed to share. 

I don't understand.. I can't comprehend how.. any of anything makes sense. There is a love switch in me that has been turned off my whole life and a resignation feeling at about everything that I can't seem to control. 

I've never opened up like this.. I feel so tired.. I just.. I've had enough of it all. Nothing feels right.. 

If any of you have any advice for me, I would really like to hear/read it. This is very important for me. I cannot stress enough how important this is. I feel like the increase of affection may make the whole difference between if I live or not, because I already know how it feels (a hug on this case) and it is a very peaceful and calming feeling.. It does has the potential to really make all the pain go away...

Does anyone know how to ease this feeling?

I cannot blame the BPD entirely because I have got myself stuck in an emotional abuse cycle where I am the abuser. The past week has been amazing but as soon as I felt comfortable again, I had doubts about him and his intentions towards me. I manifested thoughts that he is being dismissive of my feelings and questioned him about it. 

He doesn't want me anymore, he is done dealing with my erratic behaviour. I wanted to make this work but I clearly do not have the skills to control my emotions when I trigger this way and I abuse him. He is my FP however and I am very heavily reliant on his, love and support. But I want to respect his request for space and don't want to become emotionally manipulative. Moreover, he doesn't trust my words anymore. 

All of this hurts a lot, but I want to improve. If it wins him back or not. I need to improve on myself. I cannot live with myself knowing I drove away someone who was so kind and patient with me if I don't try to change my toxic behaviour. I am in DBT therapy but I'm not consistent.

It’s a frustrating paradox - when I’m in one of my episodes I want nothing more than to escape it, but when I’m not sad it just feels wrong. My partner has been trying to get me to see sense and get help but I’m so reluctant to see someone about it, mainly because I’ve had really bad experiences with professionals and have given up on it. Plus it’s really expensive. 
I don’t want to keep hurting my partner by hurting myself. I overreact to every little thing he says (or doesn’t say) and I know it’s really hard on him but I can’t stop myself from overthinking. I love too hard and feel too much, and as a result everything hurts so much more. I just can’t help but feel like I am a burden to everyone around me but I’m so absolutely terrified that they will leave me. I’m so scared I’ll be all alone when they finally see me the way I see myself. 

I’m on medication but I just don’t see an end to this cycle of pain. I want to end it all but I don’t want to hurt my family or my partner. 
I know I should be more active in helping myself but... I don’t think I’m ready to be happy. I don’t think I’m ready to heal, and that’s so painful because I can see how much my self destructive tendencies hurt those around me.

1. Get the doable done.
2. Stop for a while to feel proud of it. No matter how small, you just did something!!! Yay!!
3. Hop on that motivation rush and do another thing. It may still be small, it may be bigger. It's your call.
4. Try and do your best at it, until you feel you've done enough tasks for the day.
5. Stop and think about your accomplishments today. If you can keep this rhythm, how far can you go onto changing your life and overall mood for the better?

6. When you can't do it, try to forgive yourself instead of being harsh and negative. If anxiety kicks in and self-harm or worse crosses your head, just get your stress levels down by playing some game, listening to some music, cooking, talking to someone you like, but DON'T STAY STILL!!! Doing nothing is how you open up space for your brain to mess you up.


I know that this can be super hard or super easy for different people. If this is easy for you, then well, just spread the advice to someone who need it. If this is hard, remember that you **have** the potential to do it, you just gotta keep fighting and not give up. Eventually you will get the first step done, than the second, than the third and eventually you will see some improvement.

I really hope this helps for you guys, because it's part of what's making my life much better over the past year.

I’m 29, 30 in May- which is an age even 5 years ago I didn’t think I’d make it to. I’ve had mental health issues (depression, anxiety, mood swings) as long as I can remember. I’ve had at least one therapist who was convinced I have BPD and when I had a differential diagnostic done BPD was listed as one of things I could possibly have but that there would need to be further observation for (what I definitely had was: major depression, dysthymia, OCD, panic disorder, social phobia, and general anxiety). I’ve read a lot about BPD though and am pretty sure I had it.

I say had because I’m so much better now. It took 15 years of being in and out of therapy and trying different combinations of meds and two hospital stays, and there was a 7 year stint where I didn’t so much as hold hands with anyone because I wanted to focus on myself and getting better, but I think I did. For the past two years I’ve been stable, I’ve gone back to school, and a couple weeks ago I ended a five-month relationship-my first real official boyfriend-on really good terms (we really got along, but I told him I felt like we were trying to force something that wasn’t there, he agreed, and we went out for ice cream after).

My life isn’t perfect, but my mental health is really good. I’m calm, and even keeled, I don’t get stressed out or angered easily, and although I’m still slightly hungry for external validation it’s no where near the utter desperation I used to feel.

It took a lot of work and I’m really proud of myself. 

But I’m also scared, because I know BPD never really goes away completely, and there’s a part of me that’s really scared it’ll come back when I least expect it.

But I guess my main point is that despite what people might say about the bleak prognosis for BPD, there is absolutely hope.",26,0

I simply do not have a nuanced self esteem that builds upon my unique strengths and weaknesses.
On one day I am a confident, charismatic selfless conversationalist with plenty of interesting things to disclose about myself. My pride and self respect reign dominant and I am resilient to setbacks.

A day later, I am a fake, uninteresting anxious wreck who doesn't believe I deserve to even show my face in public and I assume everyone thinks I'm boring, needy and calculating.

I often get insecure about the dumbest things, things others hand wave with minuscule effort.
My reason ceases to be and I am suddenly on the defense, cutting people off and giving them the cold shoulder. Running away and then inadvertently pushing them away when I never really wanted to.

I try to build a realistic self image and being honest, I have fortunately adapted to a perspective that a man (or woman) has to work on him/her self relentlessly to grow into a respectable human being.

I have foregone the vile ideology of mediocrity and complacency and now strive to develop myself intellectually, physically and emotionally.

Where others play their Nintendo switch all f**king day I can say at the age of 24 that I aggressively read books and dance constantly. I will not settle for something so boring and banal and I believe eventually I will find a consistent persona to present to the world.

I am however fragile, flippant and unpredictable.
I bounce from one extreme to another and I recognize that most humans enjoy a balance that is too hard for me to grasp. I can't crack it.... No matter how hard I try, i constantly feel like giving up, but then some petty fortune will come my way, like someone will tell me I'm cool and then i feel ok again
