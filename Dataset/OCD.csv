6,You Are A Good and Loveable Person (To those coping with Pure O),131,dubsa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/dubsa6/you_are_a_good_and_loveable_person_to_those/,24,1573394593.0,"**Introduction**  
Pure OCD primarily comes down to an internalised sense of being a bad person  


So perhaps one way to beat O is to make a habit of affirming to yourself that you are actually a good person?  


i.e. When you wake up, go have breakfast + brush your teeth\*, and then before you eat your breakfast just pause and be present for a few moments/minutes as best as you can, and just calmly tell yourself ""I am a good person"", then sit with that for a few moments, and then eat your breakfast. How about that? Maybe something like that can actually work to defeat ocd  


I dont know, I have the slight feeling that the above suggestion sounds like a compulsion or a ritual so maybe thats not the best way? But it seems like a perfectly positive ritual at least..  


Basically, reminding yourself you are a good and loveable person throughout the day in some fashion, is what I am suggesting..  


Another great thing is mindfulness, I think if I had no interest in mindfulness/meditation then the effects of OCD would have been a lot worse by now. I only really started to understand what is and isnt mindfulness about a few weeks ago though, but now I feel as though I properly get what its about.   


I have been succesfully practicing mindfulness for about a week, and it removed (at least!) 50% of the anxiety I was experiencing, and then yesterday I drawn straight back into it, into the unconsciousness.  Why did this happen?  


When it comes to Pure OCD sufferers, including myself, I am certain that what the school of life said in their video is correct. Namely that it comes down to having a really strong unconscious belief that we are bad people, and so as a result we are constantly seeking out things to confirm this, because its a natural psychological process to seek out evidence which confirms our \*individual sense/image of self\*. In pure O sufferers, at some point in the past this sense of self was traumatized or damaged in some way, and the person started unconsciouslly believing themselves to be bad people, and colouring all of their thoughts adn experiences in this point of view. After all, everybody has intrusive thoughts ocaisonally, im not sure how often in non ocd sufferers, but the essential difference is those people just see the thought as random and move on, but O sufferers automatically go ""Look! See! That evidence that I AM xyz"" and then the fighting aspects of self one of which is saying ""No you arent, look, that was a meaningless thought.."" and the aspect of self saying ""No we already KNOW we are a bad person this is EVIDENCE"" start fighting, and this is basically what causes an OCD meltdown. Which I experienced yesterday and it was completely horribly deblitating.  


This is the thing. The wider public has NO IDEA how debilitating pure O is, its a really serious issue and it is NOT discussed properly in the public space. Eugh.  


Anyway the above would be my theory of the mechanism behind this, and the point of this post is im saying you (we) need to LOVE YOURSELF. Its the unconscious programming that you are by default bad which is generating this entire psychological pattern, that I am also experiencing.  


Love Yourself.  


**Thesis**  


The way to beat OCD is to slowly unlearn the unconscious belief that you automatically have something to feel ashamed of. How this is to be achieved, I am yet to clearly ascertain, leading to:  


**Question/Discussion**

I have not had therapy, so other than ERP I am not aware of therapeautic practices aimed at treating O; what are other common methods/therapeautic responses to pure O? And how would you simply explain and evaluate them? How would you do the same for ERP?  


My central thesis is that O needs to be overcome by unlearning unconscious beliefs that you are automatically a bad person, which leads to unconscious evidence seeking that you are, which causes anxiety and uncertainty, which fuels the OCD loop, blah blah blah.    


how would you critically evaluate that thesis, and, in so far as you do support its essential claim, how best, in your view, should one incorporate some a practice of reminding themself they are a good person into their life? 

What are some creative ways in which one can remind themself they are a good person?

This post is regarding driving ocd. 3 summers ago, I was driving and noticed a black figure on the side of the road. I wasn’t fully paying attention as I was driving, and when I passed the figure I was worried the black figure was a person and that I had run them over. But then I reminded myself it was just a pothole. A few days later, I was with my best friend and was like “have you ever been driving and think you hit a person” and she was like “no” and she said I would have known if I had hit someone. I recently talked to my therapist about this and she said if I hit someone my car would have a dent in it and stuff; I checked my car and it was fine, but then I thought ‘what if there is a dent on the other cars my parents have”? I also recently talked to my mom about this and she was like “honey, you would have heard a thud. I don’t think you hit anyone.” But now I can’t help thinking “what if I actually did hear a thud? This happened over 2 years ago so what if I don’t remember the exact scenario? What if I actually did hear a thud but just blocked it out of my memory? What if the police didn’t track me down because I drove away too fast so no one caught my license plate number?” I keep ruminating on these things. So I guess im asking, has anyone experienced this and how do I convince myself that I didn’t do anything?

EDIT: actually not sure if I reminded myself it was just a pothole.

EDIT 2: also, how come this is the only instance I've truly been obsessing over? if it happened now, I wouldn't really think twice.",24,0

It turns me into a selfish person who is only concerned about me and my problems...because even when my obsessions involve other people, it always relates back to ME.

It turns me into an ungrateful, pessimistic and cynical person who only sees the world as cruel and unforgiving because that’s what it feels like to be inside my own head.

A common thread I see amongst OCD sufferers are irrational fears, like death or harm.

What I fear most is having valuable moments or memories of good things or experiences being ""ruined"" by an unrelated, undesirable OCD thought.

The thing about this type of fear is that it's a self fulfilling prophecy, and actually becomes realized. I can look back on a memory, and instantly remember the thought if I had feared it. It's there forever and it bothers me. I no longer obsess, but the memory is ruined.

Now the thing is, I know that if I don't let this bother me in a given moment, I'll have a perfectly fine memory in tact. But when something triggers OCD and threatens to ruin a memory, I'm caught in a situation where I'm instantly trying desperately to not care - a paradox. Failure to be chill and let the memory slide away results in obsession, and suddenly, I'll forever associate that great movie I just watched with an unrelated, annoying person I never want to think about.

This results in most mundane memories being totally fine (I don't care if they are ruined), and my greatest, most valuable ones being corrupted (because I care about them a lot).

However in my later years I developed an OCD that requires me to KNOW and CHECK random bits of useless information that come up in conversation.  Like the name of your mates mate, the year your car was manufactured in, the name of your dog, what profession is your uncle works in. I can't move on with my life until I've CHECKED this information, and it's slowly but surely ruining my life. The bits of information are completely random and I don't know how my brain selects what or why to obsess over.

I wake up in the night to piss and it's on my mind. I try to enjoy my holidays and it's on my mind. I take the dog for a walk and it's on my mind. To me it sounds completely insane, which is probably why it's so hard for me to talk about in person. My current obsession is the name of a friends employer which came up in conversation almost a year ago.. crazy right? I'm not that friendly with them and can't just ring them up cos I'll sound like an idiot. I've spent hours on social media/internet in the past trying to obtain bits of stupid info and it's killing me.

They actually FEEL like themselves. I, on the other hand, rarely feel like I used to feel, say, 15 years ago before I began having panic attacks. Now, when I’m around “normal” people, I start to feel that I don’t feel like a normal, “integrated” person, if that makes any sense. I feel like I don’t know who the hell I am. People who’ve never experienced OCD or anxiety or depression wouldn’t even know WTF I’m talking about because they don’t know what this kind of existential/identity dread feels like.

The result, shockingly enough, is an anxiety spiral where I begin to worry that I’m somehow going to mentally fall to pieces in an explosion of panic, despair and depression. I guess it’s a kind of fear of insanity, Or fear of losing what little identity or self “okayness” that I do have. 

I don’t think I have dp/dr. I don’t feel disconnected from my body or surroundings (thank God). I just feel disconnected from any kid of “self,” and maybe I never really had much of one? How the hell does one create a self this late in the game? (I’m 45)

I know this all sounds like word salad, but I hope someone can relate. It’s like I have a fear of anxiety, so I actually GET anxiety. I have a fear of despair,  so I FEEL despair. And then it’s just a cycle of fear of these feeling states, then getting them. It makes me feel like a fucking mental invalid.

If someone can relate, I sure would love to hear about it.

I don't even want to go into detail about what the things are. I have so many false memories, and do so many compulsions to try and keep them and the intrusive thoughts away. I get what feels like hundreds of intrusive thoughts every day, especially when I go out and am around other people. I imagine myself doing the things, and sometimes it feels so real. I keep thinking, what if I've actually done the things that I'm afraid of, even accidentally? What if I've actually caused other people problems, or done things that are morally despicable? I know that I wouldn't have INTENTIONALLY done these things, and that they'd be a result of my mental illness. But does that really matter if people were harmed? Am I not guilty regardless? Do I deserve to get therapy and recover from OCD, and just forget these things, if there's even a small chance that they're true?  

Recently I keep getting the intrusive thought/feeling that I should go to the police and ""confess"" that I MIGHT have done something bad, even if it's unlikely. One of my recent (hopefully false) memories involves me doing something inappropriate in a public place. It probably didn't happen. But my OCD is telling me ""You should confess to the police so they'll check the security footage (if there even is any) and can arrest you if you're guilty. Or if you didn't do it then at least you'd know."" But I'm scared of going to the police and either getting laughed at, or seen as a criminal when I probably haven't even done anything? I'm scared of anyone finding out that I even have these fears/intrusive thoughts. People without OCD usually don't understand it, especially this really dark side of it. If I tell anyone ""I'm worried I did this thing,"" they'll most likely think I'm a terrible person.

I just stare and think about it, or distract myself with something completely different (but equally mind-numbing).

I don’t want to be on meds but after an immense struggle, I feel like I’m finally stabilizing. I went out with friends for the first time in years and years, my panic attacks and intrusive thoughts have calmed down, and I am even slowly gearing up to start some exposure therapy.

I know that it’s not and I’m not here for anyone to tell me otherwise. I guess I just would love some extra encouragement to stay on my meds and keep giving them a chance. 

They meant well, I’m sure, but I wish people would be more careful when they share the mentality that medicated folks are wasting their time or just fucking themselves up.

Towards the end of the journey my OCD flared up and it all kinda just unravelled and I was getting so enraged by the smallest things, like how slippy the seats were on the bus, cables getting in the way, people speaking loudly, etc. It all just piles on top of the other I’m sure those of you here will understand. Like I was just so angry and short fused I was whispering slurs like f**k off, go f**k yourself, etc etc etc. Everything just sort of came together; POCD, harm OCD, COCD, everything that has made my life significantly difficult and I just got stuck in a loop of negative feedback. I decided I’d just embrace the thoughts (which is a good thing right?) but I just ended up feeling gross and ashamed and so angry.

Anyway when I saw my Dad when he picked me up from the station I was in an awful mood because of this experience and I know he doesn’t fully understand, I’m trying not to let the guilt take over like god how could you be such a cold bitch to your father etc, things like that, invalidating and trying turn it on it’s head. After an awkward car ride home I just cried in the bath and now I’m in bed cos I’m fucking exhausted. Unseen wounds and struggles that I don’t know how to express. OCD tells me I don’t have OCD and I’m just a cold hearted selfish bitch and I should feel awful about how I greeted my dad.

I have urge to confess OCD with a person with whom I have a close relationship. Whenever I've felt the compulsion to confess something to him, I have felt like I have two options: either confess the problem, or have the thought of ""I should do it/why didn't I do it"" haunt me for the rest of my life. I know that this is not a ""reasonable"" worry and that I most likely will not wrestle with this particular issue forever, but this fear often drives me to confess even if I know it's not the best course of action in the long run.

Most articles and forum posts on urge to confess OCD I've seen have discussed the problem from the viewpoint of how it can affect your relationships negatively etc., and that is also something I struggle with. However, like I said I haven't seen anyone else mention this particular obsessive fear of the compulsion haunting you forever if you do not do it, and I wonder if anyone else who struggles with urge to confess OCD specifically has had any experiences like this.

ever since i was a kid i’ve had this thing about objects and media in particular giving me “good” and “bad” feelings. to this day i will not watch alice in wonderland, edward scissorhands, nightmare before christmas and other just really innocuous films. i felt like if i watched these films, it invited something or someone that would try to hurt me, and it’s just carried on to now because i’m afraid to bring those feelings back. i also used to get really pissy about what angle my door was open at because i thought if it was too closed i wouldn’t be able to escape if i was attacked, but this isn’t something that happens so much anymore. i was just so convinced something bad would happen. 

movies like harry potter would give me the good feelings, and i would have them on repeat when going to sleep. i would literally wake up in the middle of the night if they for some reason stopped playing so i could fix it. i saw these movies as a protection from whatever bad things wanted to hurt me in my sleep, and this also happened with a specific wall-e toy and stitch from lilo and stitch plush. that’s something else that’s carried onto now, like i need to have a specific youtube playlist or twitch stream on when i’m going to sleep or it will give me that bad feeling that something  or someone will hurt me. 

any insight on this is appreciated!! TIA",22,0

It's a matter of excepting the thoughts as thoughts and refusing to engage with them so they can pass into nothingness. It's difficult at first and will actually temporarily increase anxiety but as you continue to practice it and realize the content of your intrusive thoughts is irrelevant, it will take effect.

Last night i woke form a werid dream, usual werid, nothing makes sense but the one thing I recall was looking for a hotel room for me and someone to have sex in. This someone was not my girlfriend of 6 years but that isn't what set me off. When I woke up I went to the bathroom and started to remember actually cheating on her but I cant remember the face of the person, where it happened, or when it happened but the guilt feels real, the feeling that I did this is real and everytime and fight down it comes screaming back saying no I forgot this to protect her. No matter how I reason with it I can't get it out of my head. All day I found myself numb and just unwillingly to do anything. I've talked to her and she reassured me but I can't stop it form screaming in my head.

The first celebrity death that I remember becoming obsessed with was River Phoenix. I was 7 when he actually died but, years later, I ran across a picture of him in his casket and fell down a rabbit hole of needing to find every possible detail I could about his life and his death. Shortly after that, I fell into a years long obsession with Kurt Cobain, to the point of getting several Nirvana inspired tattoos. After that, things mellowed out a little bit, I got married and had a kid, and aside from an on-again-off-again spiral into all things Columbine, I was okay. That is, until Chris Cornell died. I was a huge grunge fan (obviously) and Chris' death hit me particularly hard. For weeks, I listened to nothing but his music and searched for any information I could about how he met his demise. Less than 6 months later, Tom Petty died and I had a new obsession. Every day, on the way to work, I would listen to his anthology and every night, when I got home, I would watch his documentary ""Running Down a Dream"" (it's over 4 hours long). After that, the obsession died down, so  to speak, and I've been relatively ""okay"" until today.

&#x200B;

I got out of the shower this afternoon and saw a text from my husband that said, ""Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash."" I was immediately floored. Let me pause here and say this, though: I don't give a shit about basketball. I know that Kobe Bryant played for the Lakers and I know that he was one of the greatest players of all time but, beyond that, I don't really know much about him. Oddly enough, my husband and I were talking about him last night, as I was telling him that I'd read that Lebron was about to pass Kobe's scoring record. I'm pretty sure I've never, in my life, previously mentioned Kobe Bryant in conversation, so it's particularly jarring that the one time I mention him, he dies the next day. I hate that my brain thinks that way. So, since hearing about the news, I've been trying to find out as much as I can about what happened. My husband just send me a video of the crash (he knows his wife is a morbid weirdo) and it is horrible and heartbreaking. I can't explain the feeling that celebrity deaths bring me--it's like a tightness in my chest and a hollowness in my stomach--and I find myself researching the details, in order to make that feeling go away. 

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is all just a way for me to cope with my debilitating fear of death or if it is a way for me to condition myself to the unfairness, unpredictability, and lack of control that comes with being a human. I just know that I feel awful right now, in a multitude of different ways.",15,0

So I thought I’d try here. 

Do any of you.......ruminate over people you know? Lemme explain. Sometimes I’d be thinking of someone (boyfriend, brother, parent, co worker, doesn’t matter as long as it’s someone I’ve known for at least a few years) and I’ll be thinking of what it’s like to be that person. That’s where things get strange. 

Bear with me please, this is extremely difficult for me to articulate. 

I’d think of what person is to me or how I perceive them. I’d think of my opinion of them and my relation to them. But then, I start to think of what’s it like for that person to be themselves. Take for example my brother. I saw a picture on his Ig of him and a friend and I started to think of him as my baby brother. But then, I started thinking of how he feels to be himself, or how he sees the world. I’d look at his face and say, “this is your brother, this is how his facial features are arranged to make a face you are very familiar with. You know him. But look at him like you didn’t know him. Who is he? How does he feel to be who he is?” 

I can’t explain it. But I obsess over the person as an individual and it’s almost as though I strip away everything that makes them someone I know and I begin to look at them as a stranger. And that’s the part that is so interesting to me. What does it feel to each person to be themselves? How does it make them feel? It’s like if this person had a different face, you’d still be related to them but you wouldn’t know this face. 

Guys, I’m sorry. I can’t explain it any better but I also have to ask if anyone else knows what I mean.  I wish I could show you how this works for me, because words are failing me.",17,0

Thank God she survived and now she is recovering very well in quarantine at her home;  nevertheless i feel a lot broken, beacuse since the start of this outbreak my life has been disrupted while i was recovering from OCD and depression. I lost three semesters and a half and since my university closed due to the ongoing epidemic i couldn't take my exams. So i have to restart from the beginning, once again.
Also, this summer i was planning to go to the United States: i pushed back this journey five times, and now i must do the same a sixth time. It seems like i have a curse that keeps me from going to the United States lol. Even if somehow i managed to go this summer, i fear that Americans would harass me beacuse of my nationality: in Italy Chinese people are suffering major discrimination and harassment from my fellow citizens, someone was also beaten, and i feel like i would be very unwelcome in this moment in the United States.

——“You constantly pump out shitty sub-par games filled with ads, but this takes the damn cake. Hi, I’m a person actually professionally diagnosed with OCD.. and this isn’t fucking OCD. This is closer to OCPD (obsessive compulsive personality disorder.) OCD isn’t some cute quirk or personality trait. It is a real DEBILITATING disease that some of us actually live with. Anyone who does a little giggle and says “oh I’m a little ocd teehee!” Kindly punch yourself in the face. Now since you all want to make a fucking game about “ocd” I’ll tell you what it’s ACTUALLY like. Horrible, graphic repetitive thoughts, like you killing your family or your pets whenever you put away the knives from the dishwasher. Every time I pick up my nail clippers, I imagine myself gouging out my cats eye with it. OF COURSE I would never fucking do that, but our brains love to torment us, the people that have OCD. Our brains take our deepest darkest fears and makes us think about it constantly. And what do we do? We feel the need to do compulsive actions to offset the anxiety these thoughts give us. I’m afraid to hold any sharp objects when I’m near my cats, for fear that I’ll get the urge to hurt them. Some people need to wash their hands every time they touch something. Some people need to do repetitive actions in even numbers. Some people lock their door 20 times before they leave to ensure that it’s locked. To you this may sound stupid and unnecessary, but to us it is how we must live until we find the right treatment to help us deal with OCD. And thanks to America’s shitty healthcare, many people go without the meds and therapy that they need. So I’m going to reiterate. Voodoo, if you’re reading this, FUCK. YOU. Do some motherfucking research before you decide to make and release your shitty filthy fucking vermin games.”——",17,0

It's around 5am here, I've been up since 930 am and boy has it been a day. But that's okay, I'm okay. And I just wanted to remind anyone who is here right now in search of answers, reassurance, or for anything else, you'll be okay too. I promise.

I talked to my family doc the other day, explaining to him about my mental health getting worse. He told me everyone is pretty much experiencing the same worries I am - it's just new to them, they arent used to dealing with the uncertainty of things. Us, the OCD gang, deal with this in our head every single day. The uncertainty of everything, whatever your obsession may be, it's all uncertainty. 

I'm not sure if this will make you feel better, but we are all going through the same thing right now, the fear of the unknown, doubt, uncertainty. Every single one of us, mental disorder or not. 

Today I'm grateful for my community, weve all been coming together to support eachother during this time and everybody has really been stepping it up. I'm grateful that I was able to contain my emotions today, i haven't cried or panicked. I was okay. It was rocky for a little bit, but I was able to say no, not tonight. I'm not going to worry today about things that are out of my control. 

That's not easy, but with time it comes. And there will be times where you say no and OCD comes back and tells you but yes??????? We worry now. 

I want to remind everyone healing is linear. Right now, in our situation, it's okay to not be okay. Do not guilt yourself. Were all learning together the best methods for dealing with the situation as well as our OCD. 

We will get through this together, and I'm forever grateful there are communities like this we can all talk.

Much love, and remember; were all going to be okay",21,0

Stocked up on food, disinfectant, hand sanitizer, tissues, toilet paper, gloves, soap, medication, water, etc. Constantly updated my friends and family on the virus's progress through China and that we should be prepared for it to come here. I was told I was overreacting again, just being a hypochondriac like normal and everything is fine. Turns out I was right to be worried this time. Suddenly I'm sensible, I have good foresight and good advice on how to stay safe and healthy. I was ready for this. Suddenly people want to listen to me, and I hate how vindicated I feel.

I thought I was seeing everything in shades of grey but I realise that is untrue.

I always thought that a person was just good or bad.
No inbetween, when actually it is so much more complexed than that.

My OCD tries to force me to be 'perfect' to be a 'good person' 

I have the need to confess everything I think that is not good or pure, and it is something I have been learning to deal with for a while now.

But realising there is no such thing as being completely 'good' or 'bad' has given me a perspective that goes against what my OCD has been trying to achieve.

I can not be perfect, it's not a realistic expectation of myself.
I know aslong as I do everything with my heart in the right place then I'm being me and I cannot ask any more from myself! 

It is my 5th almost whole day without complusing, it has been fucking hard and I'm proud of how I've managed to just listen to the obsessions and sitting with the anxiety and not react for 5 days.",135,0

332,My Pedophile OCD Makes me want to die,24,g0alki,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/g0alki/my_pedophile_ocd_makes_me_want_to_die/,15,1586747068.0,I recently got diagnosed with OCD I always new that it was just “Anxiety” like everyone told me my whole life I’m 15 and I’m really struggling with the fear that I’m going to be attracted to children I have a little brother and I love him to death but sometimes I feel like I need to avoid him in fear that I’m going to hurt him I have really scary thoughts that pop into my head and I for a while I would repeat the same phrase in my head over and over again “I would rather die than harm a child” but eventually that stopped working so I found myself banding my head on the wall aggressively or using my knuckles and hitting my head until the thoughts went away. I started Masturbating a lot more in the hopes that I wouldn’t be horny anymore or at least for a extended period of time. Some days I say to myself why are you worried about this its not a real thing at all and I’m not A pedophile but other days I feel so bad that I want to kill myself I worry so much about it everyday almost. I had to stop watching 2 of my favorite TV shows because the kids in them make me worry more the only thing that keeps me sane is that Ik I’ve had many other obsessions in the past and none of them turned out to be true but in the past I worried about being gay or being transgender things I’ve come to terms and now I feel if they’re were true it would be okay but being a pedophile wouldn’t be okay . I’ve also worried about becoming a serial Killer which seemed like the scariest obsession I’ve ever had but then a couple months later the pedophile obsession jumped into play and immediately beat any other obsession I’ve ever had it was just so draining for me I was always tired and soon all I wanted to do was sleep. I feel very alone and it keeps getting worst sometimes I jus want to die and I’m not like planning a sucker attempt or anything but there’s no other way to explain it. I hope that this obsession goes away soon because it’s been the longest lasting one so far I don’t know anyone else with OCD and anyone I try to talk to about it doesn’t get it because they just think OCD is being super organized or obsessive hand-washing. I’m constantly asking my family for reassurance that I’m a “good person” because it’s hard for me to say Pedophile because it makes it feel more real.

It allowed me to understand why I was having these irrational thoughts and that they’re aren’t real in the sense that by not performing these ritualistic tasks nothing bad will happen. 


I used to be controlled by superstitions and ritualistic behaviours a lot. I was in this pattern of “If I don’t do this.. something bad will happen.” I really struggled with ”I can’t risk not doing this ritualistic task”.. “what if it isn’t just OCD”. 


It wasn’t until I talked it through with my counsellor that I realised that although I had anxiety my entire life, the sickness and death of my Granny definitely triggered these ritualistic and intrusive thoughts. Around her death I found myself thinking “If I don’t pray for her today, she’ll die”, “If I don’t wear these socks today I’ll die”; I hadn’t really had those thoughts before. It was also around the time of my final exams so I would get a lot of “If I don’t do this ritualistic task I’ll fail all my exams”. 


When I realised that this traumatic event in my life triggered these irrational thoughts and behaviours, it made it a lot easier to “ignore” or dismiss them as just that. Because I understood they had a cause, it was my brain’s way of dealing with the anxiety, trying to make sense and bring order/control to the situation. It made them feel less real, like if I do go underneath a ladder, nothing bad will happen, it’s only OCD not some external/mystical force.",218,0

There are no real ""sub-types"" of OCD; OCD is simply the act of obsessing over something that causes you distress, and using compulsions to try and minimize the anxiety. I notice a lot of people quibble over what ""type of OCD"" they have which in and of itself can become an obsession, and I don't think you should put yourself through that. 

I also think it's important to minimize this idea of ""sub-types"" because people with obscure or unusual obsessions might question whether or not they actually have OCD because they don't fall into the ""types"" they've read online. Remember that obsessions can stem from *anything*, it's just that different people have different things that make them anxious.

Another thing to also always keep in mind is that your thoughts are common. What separates a neurotypical from someone with OCD is that the former can let go of distressing thoughts easily, or accept that there may be certain consequences that they can't control. Whatever lies at the core of your obsession, whether it stems from violence, sexuality, existential dilemmas, germs, disasters, objects, words, numbers, etc. a neurotypical has experienced similar thoughts before. You're not weird or crazy for having these thoughts.

hello my fellow anxiety-riddled pals! so I'm having a terrible fucking episode right now-it's lasted about two weeks and I feel like I'm in my own personal hell. It's POCD related, (which is hard enough to type out). and I just feel like throwing up, sobbing, or killing myself. I feel downright monstrous. I'm telling you this for two reasons: one, I hope it helps me not give the OCD so much power to tell other people (I never tell people about this because again, I feel like a monster). Also, I have a counseling session on Tuesday-he's not an OCD specialist, but I'm going to cautiously bring up the POCD. If he tells me I'm just a predator I probably *will* throw up and cry. I know I'm not, but someone else looking at me and seeing me as a predator makes me physically sick to even imagine. I feel terrible. Awful. I wanna die. I'm in so much agony. The thought that I could have hurt someone like that and not remember or wanted to is destroying me. I'll update y'all on Tuesday after my counseling session, and here's hoping this thought experiment of telling other people helps? 

and to everyone else going through pocd-I see you. I know you're in so much pain and I'm so sorry. You feel like you can't tell anyone, but you aren't the monster your brain says you are. I'm sorry I can't take it away but just know that you aren't alone in this.",16,0

My father is unable to get me help at the moment, but he offers no empathy at all. He follows me and makes me paranoid whenever I go to the bathroom sink to wash my hands. He yells at me and berates me, and he truly views me as if I belong in a mental hospital. Several times his emotional abuse and yelling had gotten to the point where I had full-blown panic attacks and unstoppable tears and heart pain. Today, he forced me to ""get outside for fresh air"", only then preventing me from going back inside and forcing me to mow the lawn, which is one my absolute worst triggers because I always feel that the grass and bugs will contaminate me and my clothes until they are changed.

Today, is 3rd May which completes one whole year of me battling with the fear/worry that I maybe gay. I know that so precisely because about a month into my struggle I had started keeping a journal. Today, I narrate my story.

Prologue:

In April last year I went through a really bad breakup that left me absolutely traumatized. I began associating relationships with that trauma, and thus completely lost my attraction to women, no matter how aesthetically attractive they are. The Snowballing pretty much started within a week, where I questioned if I was ever happy in the relationship (I was), whether I will ever be happy with a woman and then into territories like ""Could I be Gay?""

Months 1 through 3:

When I look back at the first three months I am, and will always be proud of how I handled myself. I was living alone in a house I used to live with my girl previously, left with those sweet memories that were now scathing. I was constantly crying, vigorously switching between gay and straight porn, avoiding any contact with men, especially homosexual men in the extreme fear of getting an erection and holding down my groinal area at all times because it used to hurt so much. My Anxiety had well and truly gotten the better of me. I used to spend time researching HOCD, joining subreddits, talking to people and creating an unending reassurance cycle. 95% of my life was this and I'm really glad to have been able to keep my job through this time, because getting to work was a pain.

Months 3 through 9:

I had already started reading books on OCD, anxiety, mental illness and as a logical INTJ I started to paint a picture of Anxiety. My journal was growing, I had started going into therapy and I started to see progress. I understood that I did not have a constant source of happiness anymore, the one companionship provided and that void will need to be filled by reassurance. In order to get that extra serotonin my brain was putting me through this ordeal. Understanding that made me seek much less reassurance. I started leaving groups I spent full days in. I dissociated myself from constant reference. I realised loneliness was an issue, so at age 23, I actually moved back in with my parents, might sound funny to some of you but that really helped.

Present Day:

I came to the realisation that living with anxiety, is okay. Last year wasn't great but, you know what, I got through it and that gives me a lot of strength. I'm starting to realise my self-worth. I'm starting to realise that I might be into companionship again, I wouldn't seek it desperately but I'll welcome it with open arms once it's here. I hate myself a little less. I practise meditation, drink lots of water, try to eat healthy (that's a lie on weekends). I'm using this lockdown period as an opportunity to learn so much, talk to old friends, forgive my ex. Do I still have intrusive thoughts? Fuck yeah. Had one today. You're on Instagram scrolling and you see a hot dude with abs and that fight or flight response kicks in. That little bit of cringe. But that cringe is what started it all, I used to mistake that for attraction, I'm pretty sure it was more of me being insecure about my own body, or could be any reason. The cringe is automatic but I decide to do nothing about it. I don't go snooping around trying to find the reason. 

If you're in any of these stages, I can tell you one thing, give it time. Don't overload yourself with ERP and ACT. They are great, but they need time.

369,Does anyone else collect/hoard things?,10,gcti5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/gcti5y/does_anyone_else_collecthoard_things/,8,1588523495.0,"I've always had and it grew stronger as I grew older. Sadly... Or maybe luckily?... i had to leave all my belongings behind after escaping my sister/family.

That helped me a ton, sure, though I do get panicky thinking about where my stuff must've went. 

Btw, here's a stupid stereotype people like to say, the whole ""ugh, im so OCD about my things"" because nope! I am pretty messy when I'd hoard stuff! It'll be everywhere and anywhere.

That doesn't mean I wouldnt get upset when stuff got dirty due to dust- but it isnt 'quirky' when a person freaks out over their compulsions and obsessions. I'd start crying or start compulsively pull out my eyelashes in stress upon seeing how messy everything is because I felt trapped and my thoughts would keep repeating how things will suddenly disappear and somethings gonna break- etc etc. Along with the dirt making me feel like Im contaminated/infected with something- not pleasant at all.

But me being me, Its hard moving stuff around because it was so much. 

&#x200B;

I cringe thinking about my old collections due to their supposed whereabouts, I had collected:

\- Candles (unlit. once you light a candle I can smell the fire-smell on it forever and it feels ruined), I had over 12.

\- Bar soap

\- Snow-globes

\- Stuffed animals

\- Pokemon cards, 

\- LPS

\- VHS

\- Coloring books/activity books

\- Bouncy balls/balls

\- Piggy banks

\- Art supplies

\- CDS/DVD

\- Bones, skulls. 

\- Dolls

\- Games

\- Rocks

\- Journals, used some, some not.

and other misc stuff that I'd hoard.

NOw I have started collecting bottle caps and can toppers, along with restarting my pokemon card collection and keeping other misc. stuff.

It soothes me though I dont like having people around my stuff. I feel at high alert whenever someone goes near my stuff., it makes me feel threatened. I dont like to be bothered when aligning everything and counting it all, that also gets me anxious as I'd usually have to recount everything again out of fear I miscounted it. 

I cant wait this pandemic chills down so I can move out and live on my own. Though, I worry if Id end up hoarding too much stuff.  It really does fill up a lot of space and I have a hard time controlling the urge to collect things regardless of the value- just seeing a collection of the same type of thing pleases me, it all has value in my heart. Theres also the whole ""it might be useful later!"" thing I struggle with.",10,0

- - - × - - - 



*Introduction:* ever since I accepted the uncertainty of my sexuality (2-3 years ago), I've let myself have crushes on girls and I also started having sexual/romantic fantasies with fictional people/characters that were female (of course, I also had with male characters but less). Before this, I only had fantasies with boys but I finally felt ""free"" after 10 years of suffering with my sexual orientation. 



**SEXUAL FANTASIES:**



Now, false memories appear. (since when my pocd started) I don't think I have ever had fantasies (romantic or sexual) with children or even young teens (like 13-15). But I am afraid I did and I don't remember and that *my fantasies indicate that I have ""p"" tendencies.* - this is the main topic of this post. I also fear that I may involved r-pe in these fantasies but I believe I have never imagined this, on purpose or unconsciously (I've reviewed every single one of them - the ones I remember) but that is why I'm making this post... To get an opinion. 



At the time that I had these fantasies, I was trying to ""explore"" my sexuality and I thought I wasn't doing anything wrong - I truly didn't!! Or I wouldn't have done it!... But now, I regret doing this for such a long time only realizing it was WRONG and shameful what I did only a few months before my OCD exploded. 



3 of all fictional characters I had crushes/fantasies were around 16-17 in the game. (Well, 2 of them weren't actually 17 (it was revealed later in the series that they were older - around 19). And the other character, I really thought she was older (like 22 - she looked mature) because there is no age reference in the game but a few months ago I searched for her age and lots of people told that she was probably in her late teenage years (16-17). 



However, I must confess that I had a small crush on my original character (she was 14-16) but I never had sexual fantasies with her. (this will later be explained) 



My masturbat- fantasies were a bit odd - Involved odd places (not exactly public places) and storylines and, in my opinion, they were a bit disgusting (perverted) in my opinion... But I don't know what ""normal"" is that's why I want to confess... 



I know that my ""wildest"" fantasies are things I would never do... Or never wanted to do (or at least I hope I didn't)! In my mind, they seemed interesting to ""try"" but in real life, nope. 



I'm not trying to shame anyone that has sexual fantasies. Part of me knows this is the result of my ""golden child syndrome"" (I am not diagnosing myself with this particular disease. But I easily feel guilty or ashamed for things I do wrong due to fear of disappointing others) and my anxiety/OCD. They trigger my sexual orientation OCD and POCD making me feel like a predator - I feel like *I* shouldn't like girls… It's ""wrong"" and I'm objectifying them… 



With one of the characters (I know this is wrong), I explored her hypersexuality in my fantasies. Everything was consensual but part of me now feels ashamed/icky about it. It is wrong! I didn't consider the consequences this would bring in real life. It involved a lot of her clingy personality. Why I liked her? I really thought she is a sweet person. In my fantasies, I would make feel happy... I guess, I saw in her what I see in myself: a weak person. And since I experienced a sort of connection with her, I also developed a crush on her, a big crush. Not to the point to take me out of the real world (I knew she wasn't real and as I'm writing this, I feel nothing but shame) but to make me feel less lonely. There were times (not always) where I wanted to be with someone and my imagination was something that helped me to fill that ""void"". Until I met my beautiful girlfriend (she's the love of my life), I was not in the best time of my life... I'm not dating her for the sake of being in a relationship because I have never dated before and I've had a few opportunities... I'm rambling... I guess that, I craved intimacy but I never sought or wanted that with someone where I didn't have a bond with. (and I'm still a virgin) 



Moving on to fictional people: Fictional people were created randomly to satisfy sometimes my romantic fantasies but mostly my masturb- sessions. 



I don't know how to explain this without sounding disgusting... I am so afraid that these ""thoughts"" expressed predatory or even r-pe behavior (I sometimes panic and cut myself over this).



I really don't know how... Hum- ""Intimacy"" (I mean intercourse) works between girls... I have heard a few things but I really don't know so I kinda imagined it with some logic and the few information I had... 



Most of my first (masturb-) fantasies, I took a more passive role... If you know what I mean (I apologise for not being too explicit) - these involved mature men and women with strong leading personalities. But after a while, I started imagining myself in a more ""active"" role (giving, instead of receiving, if that makes sense), being more confident... Thinking back, I believe the point of this was because I was so scared to be the active one (if that ever happened) so I started practicing to be more ""active"" in my mind, the one who ""takes control of the situation"" (being the ""top"", in lack of a better word) - which led me to have fantasies where I was the one to lure the other person, to make her feel confortable, to led her to engage in intimacy with me. This all feels manipulation to me now (or sexual pressure). I would never force anyone to have s-x with me. But these fantasies of me being confident and ""smooth with the ladies"" (not a cheater of course... Just being more the confident in the relationship) make me feel predatory and even led me to think about r-pe. And it's not all... But me being more ""masculine"" (I apologise for employing this awful term) in these fantasies, I often thought of the other woman being shorter than me, more feminine, more cute, sweeter, acute voice, round/soft physical features, more young looking (which are traits I associate with children). At the time, that triggered my POCD but I (tried to) dismiss those thoughts. I wish I hadn't, now I regret them entirely… in conclusion, whenever I was the ""top"" in those past fantasies (I'm so sorry if this is the wrong term), the other women were more ""child-like"". 



A visual example would be those sweet typical anime girls... Not the overly exaggerated ones but the sweetness and ""nervousness"" of one. If it makes sense. 



In this paragraph, I will reveal a particular fantasy I had (happened two years ago): In this one, I'm taking an active role in this one (the one ""touching"") - so I lure her and make her confortable enough to let me undress her and touch her intimately. My problem is because she is the ""bottom"" (again, apologies for the awful terminology), I imagined her to be a sweet, shy lady, shorter than me, with a cute/sweet voice... (I'm average-tall) so I'm afraid this was a child instead of a woman because I didn't imagine her body per se (I don't have a body type nor she had a detailed face - everything was fairly blurry/not defined) but since she had child like features (both personality, height, structure - she almost seemed to be the stereotypical sweet anime girl), I'm so afraid that I actually fantasized with a child. I must add that I was already struggling with pocd in this episode (and many other) and the entire time I was like ""this is fine. She's the same age as me. I'm not doing anything wrong."" I wished I hadn't fight it - I wished I had simply avoid having these fantasies instead.



this is the one I'm most afraid of because it involves taking the virginity of the other person and so it's more perverted. I don't remember the face I gave her or even the body type. Everything is hazy and I'm making the worse possible outcomes. Another thing I should had is that I fantasized this ""story"" a few times (maybe a lot)... And it's the one who's giving me the most disgust right now (today) because I'm so afraid it was a indeed a child. 



*I can't shake the feeling that I did something wrong!! That I fantasized with a child… I'm terrified…*



I tried to make a sketch of her face: https://www.instagram.com/p/CAHW1yyAjio/?igshid=t5hcl34za0f3


She has a round face, curly short blonde hair, big eyes… and her body was curvy. It's not a perfect drawing from what she was. 


I'm so sorry for the horrible art so here's a picture of an actress that would resemble her the most (you just need to add the curly blonde hair). Her name is Molly Quinn and she appeared on Castle TV show: https://images.app.goo.gl/DVNyEQREVDi6CqAm8


(all links are safe. I promise.) 


But I think sometimes during the fantasy she would appear younger… At the time, I tried to pay no attention to it. ""it's my mind playing tricks. She's an adult."" but… Now… I fear that she looked too young to be an adult… and more like a young teen with 13-14 (I don't know) 


I don't exactly know what she looked like… i don't remember everything and even back then, she didn't have much details too. She was fictional. Created in the moment. But… I feel terrible and frighten that she really was a teen or worse due to my ""choices of facial characteristics that day"". Doll-like… I feel such a pervert think back at this particular fantasy. And I can't remember for the life of me how she looked like exactly. 


This whole thing seemed more like an anime… Where everything is weird and out of proportion. 


I just wanted a sweet lady with soft features for this fantasy… I don't know how teens look like… Not even adults. I don't notice… I truly don't care about my surroundings. Sometimes I notice a beautiful person and I wished I looked like that.. Or I want to draw that person (yes I like to draw) 


I'm a very passive person (in terms of personality)... I would never flirt or be ""smooth with the ladies"" nor I want to! (I just want to flirt with my girlfriend) Honestly, I always felt uncomfortable when someone liked me or even when someone else was more ""flirty"" with me... Just… No.  My fantasies never involved anything dangerous (they were simple and nothing too weird, just a little bit, I think). But I'm really scared they might mean something bad.



I know that fantasies or thoughts don't represent what we want. But I feel so bad... And scared. I have been thinking that, I'm a odd person who developed sexuality in a weird way. Until I had 16-17, I was asexual with zero interest in s-x but by that age, my interest on the topic increased and I began to have sexual fantasies [I started masturb- when I turned 20 (which happened by accident)]. Even my therapist found this odd. I was also mentally sexually abused by a family member (not physically). So I'm afraid that my weird development somehow contributed for me to be a ""p"". 



At it baffles me that I used to fantasize with strong, confident women and then move over to shy, cute woman... What happened? Did my tastes changed? Or was I merely trying something new? Did I become a ""p""? 



Like I previously mentioned, I already suffered from POCD when these fantasies occurred (but this was during a good phase where I was like ""I'm not a p"") and I vaguely remember that the spike of fear interfered with some of them, which ultimately made me go into the reassurence-compulsion spree. The “I’m not a p”. My problem is I don’t remember which ones made me go into anxious mode… and I’m afraid that the one I described with most detail was NOT one of them. 



I also want to add that, two years ago, I thought the term “p” involved anyone under 18… and I was afraid the women I was fantasying with were not adults but late teens… but of course there’s doubt… and I may in fact fantasized with children. 



My fears? 


- I'm afraid I subconsciously fantasized with children or that something above means I'm a ""p"". I don't exactly have a body/face preference or a type however, by imagining ""sweet-like"" features, this means that I have a ""p"" tendencies... I guess I fell into the stereotypical ""bottom"" girl that I see on tv/anime. 


- to accept the uncertainty of being a ""p"" and engage in fantasies that are immoral and harmful to children, like I did with my sexual orientation. 



It's worth to add that I feel like a predator when I find girls pretty... I never did anything to anyone but it makes me feel gross that I found girls attractive... It felt like I was objectifying them. And this feeling started a bit before this major depressive episode started...



It has gotten so bad that I feel absolutely disgusting and I'm slowly returning to my asexual old self. To my shame (my shame only, I'm not judging others), I craved touch and affection which now makes me feel perverted. Now, I just want a strong romantic bond with my girlfriend. I wouldn't be able to do anything more to the fear of feeling like a rapist.



I still haven't discussed this topic deeply with my therapist (although she knows a major portion of it). I'm afraid she'll minimize the situation. ""it's all in your head"" she'll say. I feel like she is tired of me and my problems. She doesn't believe I'm a ""p"" but I have big problems in my head. 


EDIT: I am a monster.... I don't know if I was clear but when I add these fantasies (1-2 years ago), they were intentional and I enjoyed them, only when my OCD exploded (9 months ago) is where I started looking at every thing I did and thinking that I may have done something wrong. At the time I thought it was ok! I was making sure they were the same age as me so I didn't give a second thought - I thought I wasn't doing anything wrong. ""They are the same age as me. This is fine..."" I vaguely remember trying to make them older in my head but not succeeding...they always appeared sweet/young looking to fit the fantasy's story.

**ROMANTIC FANTASIES:**



The romantic fantasies are pathetic at some extent, cringy like most people would say if they knew. Like I said, I was alone most of the time... And the crushes on fictional characters filled this void that existed.



Before dating, I used to fantasize with flirting... But not as an adult, but as teenager... To make myself clear, I used to fantasize a lot being back in high school [ you can ask me why - I don't know. I hated high school. My opinion is that I dislike being an adult so I wished I could come back where things were simpler but not to a state of childhood... Or maybe I feel like I haven't mature since I was 17. I'm in my young 20s now but it hasn't gone well...)



I'm afraid this alone represents that I am attracted to teenagers... Despite knowing deep down that this isn't true... I may feel 16/17 inside and I look 15 (it's stupid, but I do...) but my real attractions correspond to people my age. (at least I hope so, OCD is my enemy)



I have always been a weakling... A shy girl... And in my past fantasies, I dreamed about being bold. I still have a lot of internalized homophobia and this brings a lot of guilt when fantasizing with girls...



The romantic ones are very mild... Nothing crazy flirting... But it bothers me that I have fantasized being 17 flirting with 15-17 fictional people when I was in my early 20s (does it make sense?). at the time, I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I was at the same age rank but after my ocd exploded, guilt fell over these thoughts.



The one that bothers me the most is with one character I created where she was 15-16... Because last night I began to panic over... ""what if she was younger? (like 13 or below) maturity and aged body don't exactly mean older"" ; ""what if I had sexual fantasies with her too? (I don't remember any but my brain is already creating false memories)""; ""Is she younger?"" and the fantasies involved us flirting with each other (like we had soft crushes on each other, nothing major - though one fantasy involved a quick kiss).



There was another one ""half-fantasy"" (the other person had no face where I was the strong one and the other girl was the weak one... It irks me... Because I'm the weak one.... I'm the shy one… (I hate what anime culture did to me. It disrupted my thoughts and I never watched much of it!) 



When it comes to real life, I usually find girls that are more confident, more interesting. (my girlfriend would be an example) 



Well, that's it... I feel awful... I feel so bad... I feel so cringy for fantasizing with fictional characters... Like... *I'm so gross-*

**MORAL OCD:**



I feel like I ought to kill myself… I have engaged in self harm in the past due to this topic. 


I haven't done it in a while… Hurt myself, I mean. I need to punish myself! 



Do I deserve to live?? No… 



Do I deserve to be happy?? No. 



I'm so sorry to my loved ones… I am nothing but a disappointment. I'm disgusting and shameful. I wished I was never born… I was a mistake, you know? My mom the other day was telling me how she should had never got married and she's right. I wasn't supposed to be born… It would be for the best. My girlfriend deserves someone better anyway. I should just ""grow a pair"" and end it all. I'm so sorry to my darling… You deserve better… I'm sorry to be such a disappointment to you. 



I hope I didn't forget any important detail… At least, I don't think so. People tell me I'm a good person but I'm not… I keep remembering these fantasies and it doesn't hit right. I feel like, if they knew 100% of the details, they would call me a ""p"". More than fear of being one, I'm so afraid I already engaged in that behavior… Like these fantasies and that I should commit su-cide because I couldn't forgive myself if these are really wrong (moral-wise) 



I don't move on easily. I feel ashamed for the smallest things… I feel so ugly and disgusting. I *can't* move on... 



Well, Thank you for listening to me… really, thank you.


I'm not looking for reassurence… I just want to know if I deserve to being punished or kill myself. ",10,0

Difference 2: Research tells us that OCD often makes people overestimate the risk of bad things happening.

Some backstory, I think I first started getting intrusive thoughts was 2 years ago shortly after I got my first period. I dunno if that’s related. The intrusive thoughts that hurt me the most were the vulgar imagery. They would involve animals and kids. I finally asked for help about a year later when I broke down after reading a comment on this subreddit actually. It was someone saying something like if you have thoughts like that about kids you’re messed up or whatever. Anyways I went to see a psychiatrist and I’ve been on 10mg lexapro for a while now. Had to switch psychs but I barely talked to either of them about the thoughts. Just wrote down my triggers on a piece of paper and gave it to the first one. I guess I never bothered to talk that much about it after that because they started to calm down a lot. And obviously I didn’t want to bring it up in the first place because it’s fucking humiliating and makes me feel guilty. I even saw a therapist for a bit but I stopped seeing her because I felt like I was “fine” and didn’t have much to talk about. I don’t know If all this is even necessary to put in this post and I feel like deleting it but I’ll just keep going. 

Flash forward to today I woke up and tried to go back to sleep but I kept getting the kid related intrusive imagery. I can’t go into detail. I tried to soothe myself and tell myself they’re irrational. But it didn’t work. So I started to cry and I remember thinking when the thoughts didn’t stop that all I wanted was to be asleep or sedated. I think I know why I might be getting them again. I started watching a show called Criminal Minds which is honestly really triggering sometimes but I became so attached to one of the characters that I don’t want to stop watching. I also forgot to take my lexapro last night. Which I don’t even know how much that effects my thoughts but idk it feels like I should mention it.

I just wished I could enter a fricking room without having to go in and out for half an hour, so I don't ""die"". I wished I could spend time with family and friends and just be happy. OCD has brought me so many problems. I am failing school because I can't concentrate on work because of intrusive thoughts, and I don't know how to tell my teachers that It's not really my fault and that sometimes I try very hard but sometimes it just seems impossible. I also can't hang out with friends like I used to before, not even on FaceTime. I frequently get into fights with other people because I am disrespectful or things like that when I am doing compulsions, and I just want to tell them I just don't want ""bad things to happen"". These days I just want to do absolutely nothing all day, because I've lost the ability to do basic things. OCD is sometimes making me develop depression, which just adds an extra wave of problems. 

I have gotten better tho. Before I used to shower for around an hour and used to bleed from showering too much. Now I shower for around 20 minutes and have a healthy skin again. I've stopped excessive hand washing and my hands feel soft again, after a pretty long time. And now I can see people without thinking I'm about to kill them.

But still, I don't feel nearly as happy as I used to, and sometimes I feel hopeless. And I wonder if I will live all my life like this. I'm not suicidal, but sometimes I just want everything to end. 

However, I recently told my parents that I want professional help. They don't know how bad I feel but I will start to go to therapy soon. I hope I will be able to live as I used to soon.

But on the up side, I've started noticing that my mood is hell lotta better, I'm started consciously realizing with clarity the various aspects of my life and the possibility of improving/advancing on those dimensions - intimate relationships, career, friends and family, time outside of work, physical and mental health, etc.

I'm very extroverted and I've started having ppl over all the time (something I never did before). I've started working on cooking - one of my passions, and I send over everything from pies to black forest cake to my friends periodically. I often have ppl over at my place to try out whatever new dish I'm cooking that day. Most of my evenings my house becomes an open-house party with a constant stream of freinds, colleagues, acquaintances and family coming in and out.

For the first time in my life I've actually started noticing girls (I'm Male, 26) and have started hitting on girls (while staying the requisite 2 feet apart) and asked them if they'd be interested in a virtual coffee date on zoom. I'm way more interested now in checking up on how my friends are doing.

Did this happen to someone else after they started taking zoloft (sertraline) for a while? Only now did I realize that my ""default"" state always has been to be depressed/anxious most of the time and have a bad mood.

**EDIT: Sorry for my delay in getting back to you guys, it was (as you might've already guessed) because of the side effects of Zoloft (Sertraline) that I've been experiencing lol. Answers to some of the most common questions in the comments:**

**Q1: What about side effects? If yes, how are you coping with them?**

A: Hell yes! I've suffered from

* extreme fatigue/tiredness the whole day
* insomnia
* Nightmares (though I also got them from the sleeping pills that I took intermittently for short periods of time - clonazepam, trazodone and zopiclone), but they went away after I was on a stable dosage (200 mg) for like 2 months
* adverse sexual side effects (I can get an erection, but the sensitivity in my penis is drastically reduced, and orgasms are very muted and the pleasure is only around 10% of what it used to be)
* occasional (though not very frequent) moderate heartburns (though Tums and 2-3 hours makes it go away)
* little bit of nausea and diarrhea at the beginning (both of them have gone away)

The extreme tiredness and insomnia have more or less gone away 3 months after I reached a stable dosage (200 mg). Also, I was intermittently on clonazepam, trazodone and zopiclone for a few short periods to help with the insomnia. PS: clonazepam is super scary, be very careful with it.

The adverse sexual side effects haven't gone away or gotten better, and I'll be starting Wellbutrin soon to counter them. Praying it all works out. Fingers crossed.

**Q2: What happened to your intrusive thoughts, OCD triggers and compulsions?**

A: They still come, and they are still scary most of the time, but their intensity has kinda reduced, and I find it kinda easier not to give into them. Note that I also have an amazing therapist with whom I have been doing ERP long term which has significantly contributed to managing them.  


**Q3: How long did it take for you to start seeing the benefits?**

A:  It took me around 3 months after I reached a stable dosage (200 mg) for the benefits to start kicking in.",178,0

I was beyond SHOOK. I'm still convinced that she doesn't actually know me properly and if she did she wouldn't think that, but she was listing all these small things I've done these past few years and I was honestly so touched to realise that she thought I was a nice person for having done all those things and that she remembered them when I've basically forgotten about them (honestly she's the real nice person here) It made me feel quite good about myself, also quite guilty because whenever somebody thinks I'm nice I always just feel like I'm lying to them or manipulating them, because, like all people, I do lie sometimes.

457,"MY OCD got 110% better when I realized intrusive thoughts were not ""normal"" and that they would, in fact, go away if I ignored them. This is NOT meant to be medical advice. It is an experience I had with OCD.",49,hdfhxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/hdfhxb/my_ocd_got_110_better_when_i_realized_intrusive/,4,1592776829.0,"I know everyone's experience will be different, I am sharing mine. Please don't take this as medical advice. This is me sharing my story and experience with OCD. I am new to this sub, if this seems like medical advice, please let me know if there is a better way I can phrase this because that is not my intention at all. 

Before I was diagnosed with OCD, I used to think every thought I had was something that could legitimately happen. I thought my brain was ""warning"" me. I thought that was why it showed me so many different, usually bad, scenarios. 

Now, if a ""bad"" scenario comes into my mind, I ignore it completely.  It took a while before I could recognize a ""bad"" (intrusive) thought. Usually I can tell if it's intrusive if it makes me feel really nervous. As soon as I feel that nervousness creep up on me, I recognize the thought as intrusive and allow myself to ""have"" the thought but not dwell on it. I do something else. Play a game, refocus on what I was doing before, ect. I used to dwell on the thoughts because I thought it was ""real,"" as in all the scenarios in my head were really things that could actually play out in real life. Now I know they are intrusive thoughts and most are illogical. 

Because of this, I have almost no OCD symptoms anymore (yes, I still have intrusive thoughts and do perform rituals sometimes, but it has come down so much that some days I forget I have OCD.)

I guess just knowing how the human mind works (or at least my mind in particular) has given me a sort of ""power"" over it in a way. 

This is not supposed to be some magic cure for OCD because it's just not. This is a story from my OCD journey that helped me. I cannot emphasize enough that this is not treatment or medical advice. 

For context, I did CBT for a while, but this self-realization has been the biggest help in my OCD journey. I also don't take any medication for my OCD. I never have, though I was asked if I wanted to, I felt I wanted to do CBT without it to start and CBT has been enough for me. 

I guess I'm posting this on here because I want to share my experience and ask others if they have had any similar experiences or ""Self-realizations"" that really helped them.

A gifted student and hard worker with frequent contributions to charity and local volunteer efforts, one would think Tom was a beloved member of the community; not even letting his long-standing OCD get in the way of his efforts.

""Tom is fucking insufferable,"" says Mike Dotero, who has accompanied Tom for fifteen years as, allegedly he claims, a best friend. ""We had lunch together at the pizza shop, it's been a weekly tradition of ours for years. I told him 'Thanks for the meal', and the bastard just smiled at me. How could he not pick up that I was criticizing his spending habits? That prick bought groceries TWO days before, why couldn't he just make me a sandwich and be done with it? Didn't even let me split the bill...""

Even Tom's own mother, Mary, tends to agree. ""I've loved Tom for as long as I remember. But this OCD thing has become too much. I'll ask how he's managing, and he'll give me this whole spiel about feeling guilty and wanting to punish himself. I tell him to do as his therapist instructs, but I really just want him to get the fuck over it."" We reached out to Tom's therapist for comment, but she was apparently busy crying in her office after Tom scheduled more appointments. Despite the disappointment of a child Tom has become, Mary still sees the light in him occasionally, such as when he helped her and his father clean out their attic.

But Tom's waste of humanity isn't just confined to his inner circle, oh no. In a nearby penitentiary, Don Criper is next-in-line on death row for the brutal 2004 murder of his wife and four children. ""I've never met Tom in my life. But when I heard of his birth around town, I was thrust into a years-long downward spiral of depression and anger."" Criper reports that his disgust towards Serif's existence was more repressed than his emotions growing up. ""In fact, I may have even been framed. He must've been what, 7 or 8 at the time? Little cunt could've definitely wielded an axe.""

Despite attempts to keep our distance from this abominable lunatic, we can report at press time that Serif has been incessantly scratching his wrists upon hearing Criper's execution date.",30,0

I've done this my whole life. My brain picks someone new every several years.

I've been told over and over by O.C.D specialists and therapists that continuing to obsess, try to control everything, try to figure things out, solve problems, etc. is just feeding into my O.C.D. However, there was always a small part of me that thought that maybe they were wrong. Now, after a long time of struggling with this (I was in 1st grade when I was officially diagnosed with O.C.D and I'm 21 now), I feel like it's starting to sink in that I just can't give any attention to my thoughts. I give my thoughts/O.C.D an inch and they take a mile.

I really hope that I can keep up this new resolve. I hope that I don't slip right back into giving my thoughts all my attention as soon as I have an especially bad night of sleep or something (my chronic insomnia makes my O.C.D much stronger).

STRUGGLING to run my business, can’t get out of bed, feeling super depressed, anxious and immobilized with all the running thoughts. The worst part of it all is that I stopped my medication just before lockdown and feeling guilty to go back on anything as I’ve been on it for 8 years.

Since I started researching my intrusive thoughts, it dawned on me that the things I have suffered from in the past were almost all OCD mental compulsions: checking, seeking reassurance, justifying, arguing, pushing away. I used to think an OCD compulsion was only something you did physically: tapping, touching, arranging, etc. Because of this, I never even thought of researching about OCD when I was looking up help for my anxiety.

I will keep this as short as I can. 

I'm a female in my 20's, I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and Pure-O OCD since I was 13.

I was never really into porn or such thing, because it grosses me out watching real people having sex, as in I don't know if they were obligated to film these things, or if they were abused, so I don't like it. Recently I thought I would give porn a try and watch 3D animated porn instead, I stumbled across a Pokémon characters porn. I was aroused BEFOREHAND, it wasn't the porn itself that aroused me, but I did watch to keep it going. Few days later I had the realization the characters are literal kids! And that honestly terrified me so much, I cried so much after I realized that, I still do

I did NOT search for cp, I do NOT consume such horrific content, I WOULD NEVER harm a kid, I am NOT attracted to them in any shape or form

But I know for a fact that even if it's not a REAL kid, that pokémon porn is counted as cp too

I didn't realize they were kids when I was watching it, I also didn't consider it because I was watching porn, and that's enough for me to know that there SHOULDN'T have any kid on these! They didn't look like kids at all too  
But now my brain is telling me that I watched cp, that I am some sort of pedophile, that society will hate me, that I need to be judged, that I should be in jail, that I am a monster, that I shoulnd't be alive, and I am honestly freaked out and disgusted by myself, I feel guilt and hate towards myself and I wish I never had watched that

I also have a memory, that in all honesty I don't recall. Maybe it's a false memory my brain created, that after that pokémon porn, another cartoon porn came and I thought ""I can't be watching this, they are underage"" and stopped masturbating/watching, but I don't really remember that, I can't tell if that is true or not and it's making me sick

And now the thoughts won't leave me alone, my anxiety is badly triggered, I am constantly scared and feeling bad for what I watched  
Sometimes I am scared of wanting to kill myself because of that too

Also, I am now I am literally scared of kids, if I see them I will look away, if they appear in a show I am watching or something I will stop watching, etc

I have reached out to a psychiatric and and therapeutist in hopes they can help me, appointment is soon, but for now I guess what I am trying to look for is reassurance? That this is somewhat normal? That I AM NOT a monster? I don't know  
I don't know, I just need some support because I am still horrofied and scared and the thoughts just won't leave me alone and I feel like crying at how bad this whole thing is

2 months ago I was in insufferable excruciating mental pain caused by rumination basically from the point I woke up in the morning until I went to bed and then repeat again the next morning. The obsessional thoughts where constant, very intense from anywhere from 5-6-8 hours a day. It was pure hell, worse than I ever had it before and it was like being stuck in a torture chamber just that it was my own head and I couldn’t get out.

I couldn‘t take it any longer and I told myself if I lived even one more year in this misery I would end it all. 

Amidst corona I sought treatment and was lucky to get into specialised program that combines group therapy and confrontational therapy. It has made a tremendous difference in my life. I go there every week and meet people that suffer from the same or different obsessions and understand the torture OCD causes. 

It also was a massive wake up call for me because I met people there 30-40 years older than me who completely isolated themselves, whose illness robbed them of having a relationships, friends, a career, a family. It’s so sad because they are incredibly friendly and thoughtful people. They just waited so long to get proper treatment and they’ve lived with this crippling illness sometimes for 30+ years. The longer you wait the worse it gets.

It has already been really bad over the past 5 years but I had refused to get help and told myself every day to just keep it together, buried myself in work instead of getting help until also my work life suffered, basically the only thing I had. I let the illness take more and more space up in my life until I had no life anymore.

If any of you experience this daily hell and are hesitant to ask for help, I urge you to please please go and get help before your life breaks apart. OCD is no joke, it is a debilitating illness and YOU DON‘T HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THIS.

Since I’ve sought treatment I’ve experienced peace I haven’t experienced in a very long time. 

There are still days where rumination kicks in but therapy reduced my obsessions by about 30%-50%. I still have a long and strenuous journey with a lot of expo work to do, but I have found some will to live again and I hope so can you.",36,0

""You're a bad friend. You've done so many horrible things to your friend in the past. Why does your friend still hang out with you? She probably feels trapped. You've manipulated her into still talking with you. She knows you're emotionally fragile, and the only reason she ever forgave you is because she's afraid of upsetting you. She hasn't responded to any of your texts in a while, and as soon as you went online on your Switch, she went offline. Coincidence? I think NOT! She clearly didn't want you to know she was awake because she doesn't want you to talk to her. She's finally gotten fed up with you.

But at the same time, isn't worrying about your friend not responding to you immediately a sign that you're a possessive, abusive person? You deserve to be treated this way, why are you upset? You drive everyone away with your constant toxicity. Everyone that associates with you wants to get away from you. You've probably made everyone ever involved in your life feel abused.""

Essentially, I get anxiety over something (say I see a number that reinforces an intrusive thought and causes anxiety), and the only way I feel I can amend it is to engage in rituals. However, then there is a secondary anxiety where I am afraid engaging in the rituals, because it’s giving into my compulsions, is bad and going to make things worse, especially if I end the ritual on an anxious thought. So it ends up feeling like “damned if you do, damned if you don’t”. This causes me to keep reengaging in a “loop” of compulsions, trying to end them the right way or until I begin to realize just how absurd it is what I’m doing. It’s the anxiety caused by intrusive thoughts, reinforced by the anxiety caused by the shame of engaging in OCD, creating a messed up yin and yang scenario that feels impossible to escape.

Right now this is mostly due to this person I’ve been flirting with/planning on seeing. I told myself at the start of everything that I shouldn’t engage in my rituals/compulsions, it would make things worse. But then I see something like the number 6 popping up everywhere (bad number), which tells me things might go bad. I try my damndest to not give in, but it becomes so overwhelming that I tell myself it would be better to give in and possibly stop things from falling apart, so I engage in the ritual and lo and behold! I now have even worse anxiety because I’m telling myself “This ritual has altered your fate, things are now ruined with this person”. So I try to reengage with the ritual again, over and over, until things feel “okay”, or I’ve done it so much I realize how ridiculous it is and that it’s all in my head, which I usually can’t even achieve without ending the ritual a certain way.

It is absolutely maddening. I try to remove myself from the OCD headspace, tell myself “This is one of many anxiety attacks that you’ve felt everything hinged upon; its not special, it’s not critical, it’s just another episode”, but that can become so quickly crushed by more anxiety.

616,My OCD isn't OCD enough?,20,iwi0de,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/iwi0de/my_ocd_isnt_ocd_enough/,13,1600622590.0,"So basically a therapist I went to go see told me I have OCD. Since about 5 years ago I started repeating 2 phrases over and over again in my head (related to religion). They are worst when I am reading or watching something, or when I hear certain cuss words. There is no specific number of times I have to say it, I just have to keep saying it until I feel I said strong enough and I feel good. It's gotten to the point that now I have to spell it out in my head to really feel I said it correctly. This is obviously an everyday occurrence. I probably say those phrases about 15-40 times and hour depending on what I'm doing. I can't not say it. If I don't I will feel like I'm a bad person and my mind just feels like exploding.

I have other small things like a nose tic that I have to do, especially when I think about it. I've had this since I was little. But it's not like an actual involuntary movement. I just have to scrunch my nose every so often, if I don't I feel uncomfortable.

However coming on this sub it seems that my OCD isnt OCD enough to be considered OCD? I keep reading about people having these intrusive awful thoughts and I rarely get those. I get them, but not as often as it seems people with OCD get them. I get thoughts like, if this happens I'm going to die, and then I try to talk myself out of it and it's 50/50 if I'll actually believe it. But I'll eventually be able to be like ok just don't think about it and move on. 

But sometimes I can't talk myself out of my thoughts. Even if I'm like okay no that didn't happen the way you think, and I still can't let go of it maybe being what I thought, and it'll consume me until I openly talk about it with someone who can prove my thoughts wrong.

But then sometimes I'll wonder if I locked my doors and if I think I did, usually I'm good to walk away and not check. Sometimes I just have to check because if not someone might come in that night and kill or rob us. But if I check once I'm good. So that makes me wonder if I really have OCD since I don't have to keep checking? Like is my OCD not bad enough to be considered OCD? 

Sorry if this is dumb to ask, I just don't know if I should trust the therapist I went to go see. I saw her one time and briefly told her about my repetitive phrases and she's like yeah that's OCD. But is it? Or is it just me being paranoid? A lot of people on this sub seem to have it really bad and they have these terrible thoughts that I can only image must torture them, and a lot of the things I read I can't relate to. Only to small things like not trusting logic sometimes. I feel guilty for saying I have OCD knowing people have much worse OCD than I do.
So is this even OCD? I just want some thoughts.",20,0

Instead of cleaning and spiraling into an ocd anxiety attack, I am laying down with my kitten sleeping on me, cbd capsule taken, hanging out on my phone. It could be better. SO much better. I’m no where close to how I’d like to relax. But it could be worse and I’m too tired for worse. So even though I wasn’t “sure” if I could ignore uncomfortable and painful obsessions telling me to clean and worry, I stayed laying down, spending time with my kitten who I love. 
It genuinely feels nearly impossible if not beyond impossible to face the ocd and tell it no. But I’ve done it. Multiple times a day every day. More and more, and sometimes I fall back. But that’s ok. And it doesn’t feel ok a lot. It breaks me down to my weakest most vulnerable crying for help self. But I refuse to be hopeless. I know how hard it is to have that attitude. I’ve felt hopeless for 12 years with this ocd. Just know that ocd tells you there’s no choice. But YOU choose, not ocd. All he does is talk. And your brain can go on auto and listen. Trust me I still do hundreds of compulsions a day. And obsess into alternate realities daily. And exhaust myself into psychosis regularly. But I fight. Why? What if it never goes away? Well I have to be in this earth, living as the human I am. So I might as well do my best to feel and think the way I want to. The way I would choose. Not someone else. Not how ocd would choose. They don’t get to live my life, I do. It’s not just about being deserving or worthy of my life, of your life. We just exist. Exist the way you would. 

That’s what keeps me going. And my baby kitten :)

I am asking for help because I have no Idea what to do at this point. My son is 11 years old he was always a bit of an anxious kid, had a hard time making friends - was just a little different but was very loving and probably the most empathetic kid I have ever met. For the last year or so his anxiety seemed to have grown  He was constantly washing his hands ( to the point of hurting the skin  because it became so dried out ) Then it escalated to the point he didn't want to sit on any furniture because of germs. Then he is refusing to sleep with blankets or on a sheet ( even though I have explained that sleeping on a mattress directly is much less clean)  I was thinking this was likely , pandemic , puberty , odd kid behavior. However then on the first day of school his dad called  - not to ask how school was but to ask "" why  he (  our son ) doesn't  tell him and his wife that  he love him more."" After getting of that call it was like something snapped and everything  was worse - he started repeating himself over and over ""until he gets it right ""and for it to be right his hands need to be in the right place and he has to point his feet in the right direction doing this was causing him great distress so I brought him to a phycologist she has referred him to a physiatrist  urgently  however the soonest we can get in is mid-December and it seems every day is getting worse.

He now can only write on every forth line in his school books , and he has to ask for clarification when anyone uses the word- it , that   and some other trigger words - and not only when people are talking to him if he hears them in a song or on t.v. - or over hears a conversation. He no longer wants to change his clothes  because all the other clothes are dirty and his brain will be mad at him. He doesn't want to shower because the shower is dirty ( it is clean I swear - he thinks it is dirty because people are naked in there )  He is suddenly made uncomfortable writing the letter O. He can't wear sweaters ( which he used to love ! )  He says his brain will be mad at him if he does any of the things that it tells him not to do. Today he was hungry got up to get food then stopped because his brain wouldn't let him eat, we planed to make iron on patches for his clothes today which he was excited about then right before we started he started to cry because his brain wouldn't let him. He is getting more and more depressed and detached he keeps talking about how  he is scared and this will never get better.

For now his family doctor has prescribed mild anti-depressants - we are bringing him to therapy once a week ,  we have taken him out of school on Wednesdays ( until we get this under control )  because school is a big point of stress for him and  I am no longer making him go to his fathers house ( he is aloud to go if he wants and his dad is welcome to visit him here  going there was a huge point of stress)

To start, I’m 16 and I have ocd, depression, mild ptsd, and both social anxiety and general anxiety. 

I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I have really severe paranoia that I’ll be murdered. I sleep with a knife in my room and check the doors all the time to be safe. The other day I was cat sitting at someone’s house (so I was alone) and the floors kept creaking and I full on sobbed bc I was terrified that I was about to be killed. I genuinely believed I was about to die.

Along with this, I get afraid that someone will kill me or other people when they’re angry. So, for example, my younger siblings were arguing earlier (they’re 8 and 12) and I yelled at them and sent them to bed. I feel so freaked that one of them might just kill the other or that they’ll kill me because I yelled at them (I try not to yell as I don’t wanna be a part of their trauma/yelling is bad)

Is this normal? I don’t know what to do. I wanna talk to my therapist about it but I don’t want to get anyone in my family in trouble. I feel this way with basically everyone when they’re angry at me, or if they have any sort of mental illness. I don’t really know what to do.

I don’t know what kind of advice I’m looking for. I guess I just wanna know why this happens and if there’s something I can do to fix it? And is it ocd related?",18,0

Anxious attachment is a term used when a person fears disapproval and rejection from people they have relationships (of any kind) with.

I have seen, over and over again, people thinking of OCD as negative rigidity, and that it must in turn be combated with healthy rigidity. That hasn't been my experience. Uncertainty, feeling a need to re-evaluate, and feeling a need to better prepare for what a person or situation might want or require of me, have been the drivers in my life. 

In the years around when I was in college, I was just starting to come to understand my OCD and how my life experiences had shaped my fears and expectations. Many of the theories I learned as a psych undergrad focused on absolutes: ""unconditional love"" or preventing ""musterbating"" and avoiding ""shoulding on yourself"" and so on. As I saw it, they proposed that the solution to many psychological issues, particularly in relation to anxiety, would be found in commitment to a rigid idea or plan - whether that was accepting everything about yourself, rejecting the desires and concerns of others, or dedicating oneself to a plan of exposure or repetition. And when I saw a later theory about ignoring fear and pursuing what you wanted, I felt that I couldn’t trust that, either.

The therapists I saw generally endorsed those rigid notions that I learned in undergrad, and it always felt sloganistic and disconnected from my actual experience. I had worries that were legitimate, I had fears that couldn't be controlled by willpower or affirmations that I didn't believe, plans for exposure or shifting my thoughts usually backfired via my OCD latching on to fears about said plans, and so on. I got more and more stressed out about being unable to be understood and improve, and the result was that I got worse while seeing those therapists, rather than better. And that made me anxious about therapy and “healing strategies” in general.

All these years later, I feel that I'm seeing that my issues come less from seeking absolutes, and more from trying to respond to many possibilities. Less ""should""ing and more ""should?""ing. Anxiety-brain thrives less on a need for exactness than on a fear of the unknown, fear of being unprepared, and fear of being unable to handle it.

My problem wasn't telling myself that I *should* do something, but in fearful *wondering* if I should do this or that or one of many other alternatives - and what the possible negative and positive results of each might be. I couldn't simply dismiss the possible outcomes out of hand. And I often wasn't capable of feeling settling in a belief that something was right or wrong, rational or irrational. And when other people would give me advice or tell me I should think, their perspective was often so far off from my reality that it was counter-productive. They couldn't anticipate what actions or plans were actual possibilities for me, or what possible consequences might result, given my circumstances, as accurately as I could.

Neither explorative Rogerian ""give the person control and acceptance"" nor directive Ellisian ""tell the person what to think"" nor shallow Skinnerian ""plan a method of reconditioning for the person"" worked for me with basic therapeutic guidance. They weren't suited to the interlocked cores of my problems, because they couldn't account for how my lived experience shaped my reactions, thoughts, and feelings. And they didn’t understand the depth of difficulty with feeling stable and comfortable that comes with my OCD.

The intersection of OCD and Complex PTSD wasn't something those people were knowledgeable enough about to address. The underlying ideas of exploration, outside perspective, and positive experience (and absence of negative experience when trying things) weren’t wrong, but I had lost the ability to believe that a therapist could help me with utilizing those ideas.



In an article published about a recent [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200227144320.htm), the authors concluded that people with higher OCD symptoms have a difficult time believing that they can do well in new experiences, even when they've done well in similar previous experiences. [Others](https://theconversation.com/brain-scans-reveal-why-it-is-so-difficult-to-recover-from-ocd-and-hint-at-ways-forward-74092) have shown evidence that the brain of a person with OCD is impaired in sending a signal that something has become safe, if they have previously experienced it as unsafe.

In combination with my history of fawning and anxious attachment, the research above explains a great amount of my life and the progression of my OCD. I don't think there is a rigid set of things that I must do in order to be safe; I feel that nothing is stable, and the most likely way that I can have safety is to explore and prepare as much as I can (to expand my knowledge and abilities related to everything I can find out about it), and to avoid a situation if I don't feel that I'm able to be prepared enough for it. Sometimes that means that I feel unable to be prepared to explore certain things (attempt to gain certain knowledge), and that will lead to avoiding those elements fo preparation (such as going ot therapy or reading books on healing).

And when I am in a situation, my mind is rapidly switching between possible ways someone might react to various things that I might say or do, or between possible courses of action I might take in order to reach the best possible outcomes. Outwardly this might look like avoidant procrastination, but it's actually hyperactive problem-solving. I'm trying to solve many problems at once, and I'm trying to narrow down a field of tons of possible goals and plans. And I can't prioritize when there are several important problems to be solved, because what to prioritize is itself a problem to be solved.

It isn't that the right answer must be reached, but that comprehensive knowledge must be attempted as rapidly as possible, so that I can have the best chances of success regardless of what happens.

This occurs even with cleanliness compulsion: If I feel that I could get clean, but I'm not sure what is sufficiently clean, then I will problem-solve while attempting to get clean. Hopefully methods that have worked before will get me at least most of the way there, but I have to re-check and adapt as needed. If I feel unable to get properly clean, then I often will simply avoid trying to. If I'm in the middle of cleaning when I feel that I’ll be unable to get clean, I will try to do my best to get clean, and stop either when I feel that I’m clean enough for the moment, or when I feel that I don’t have energy and time / I feel to distressed by my inability to get clean (and, usually, the increasing instances of occasionally getting less clean while trying to clean myself sufficiently). If I feel too unclean and yet also unable to get sufficiently clean, I might simply have a breakdown. 

Everything becomes a battle of anxieties: Which makes me more afraid? How contaminated/uncertain I am now, or failing to get as clean/prepared as I feel that I need to be?

Failure to be prepared enough or to handle a situation that I’m in means that I will be more worried about failing again in the future, which increases the likelihood that I’ll avoid similar situations in the future (e.g. avoiding preparation required for a chemistry class assignment, avoiding chemistry in general, avoiding therapy). And the most likely circumstance in which I might try again, is one in which I’ve spent extra time and effort preparing. And if I fail after putting in more preparation work, I’ll be even more likely avoid what I was preparing for, and to avoid using that preparation strategy for that problem again. And, if I try many methods of trying to prepare adequately, or the results go poorly enough, I might avoid trying to prepare at all anymore. Superavoidance. 

That might be true even when the situation that I was trying to prepare for is unavoidable. With enough avoidance of preparation and an unavoidable situation, likely comes doomsaying and destruction.



I've recently taken note that what OCD ultimately boils down to, at least for me, is attempting to get a situation out of mind and out of body. This “get it out” or “get it dealt with” goal seems to be shared with all anxiety-related/panic-related experiences and reactions (anxiety disorder, panic disorder, compulsively seeking to relive or re-script experiences that harmed you, exploring things that seem dangerous, etc). 

The direct situation the person wants to be rid of might be the experience of a memory, a thought, a physical feeling, or just a vague anxiety. And a larger situation a person wants to get rid of might ultimately be a cause (e.g. a traumatic experience) or an effect (e.g. OCD, PTSD, or problems/experiences that they cause). 

My compulsions are about trying to remove or prevent something - either a danger that is physical or a danger that is in my mind. My obsessions are about what compulsive reactions might be best. When I feel compelled to obsess over a question or fear in my brain or a reaction of my body, it's no different than feeling compelled to obsess over whether or not I have properly cleaned something, or how I might go about doing a better job of it, or ensuring that I have done it.

Ensuring is the last step, not the first. It's seeking stability once I feel that I've either possibly succeeded, or I've done the best that I can.

Certainty, or perfection, is not the ultimate goal. Safety is. I just sometimes feel that perfection might be required, because I've been working so exhaustively to solve something, and yet my brain hasn't stopped sending the fear and danger signals; the obsession and compulsion signals. And the feeling of a requirement of perfection (or at least near-perfection) is magnified when my attempts to achieve goals or handle situations repeatedly fail, end badly, or end very badly.


So what can be done? If my experiences with therapy so far didn’t work, in part because I couldn’t trust that they will work, because my brain said that I must not trust previous successes and must fear that I am not prepared/capable and that I am in danger, then what might work?

Honestly, I can only say that some things snuck up on me. I gradually established a friendship over two years. It was scary as hell. I slowly got better at not trying to fix her problems, and slowly got better at not looking to her for solutions to mine. I slowly stopped trying to reassure her that everything would be ok, and slowly got better at not dumping things on her or asking her to give me comfort. I slowly started to feel that I didn't need to do or be anything for her to care about me, and that I didn't need to have any clear reason I could articulate for why I cared about her. It was enough that we cared about each other, were good for each other, and wanted each other in our lives.

Somewhere along the line, I also became more comfortable with things not working out. I used to be so terrified of anything I did going wrong. Of being unprepared. Of being unable to keep being suitable or adequate for something that I had been successfully managing so far. Of being suddenly rejected, despite having had a good connection with someone so far. I'm still afraid of those things, especially when a situation or relationship is new, but less so. 

And somewhere along the line, I felt more self-worth, and self-compassion and giving myself breaks became easier. Going after what I wanted became easier, instead of focusing on and preparing for what I felt others might want. I felt like I could go after my direct desires, instead of feeling like I needed to sacrifice myself to get safety and then hope that I could become happy in whatever situation those sacrifices had left me in.

And somewhere along the line, I started being able to believe some positive affirmations. And it became easier to distract myself in healthy ways when had I fears and looping thoughts. And I started wanting to not respond to moments experiencing of painful memories by wishing that I was dead, or feeling a desire to self-harm, self-criticizing, or wishing that the moment hadn't happened because moments of mistakes or flaws seem unallowable for me. It became easier to accept myself as human; just the result of my life experiencs and genetics - no different from anyone else in that fundamental way. 

And I became able to detach from a need for the future to be one way or another, and instead be glad to enjoy the positives in my life while they are part of it, and just keep moving forward with positive purpose. It's hard, but it's something that I am able to do more often now.

I've become more comfortable with thinking like ""I want x, and I'm going to try to get it despite my fear. If I don't get it, I went for something that I wanted. And sometime when I go for what I want, I'll get it. Just keep doing the work. It's ok if the outcome isn't what you expect or want this time.""

And somewhere along the line, it became easier to believe that I have a “good enough in this moment” sense of what is right or wrong, or likely to go well or poorly, or be good or bad. Enough to be able to make decisions, while knowing that I’ll always try to improve it for the future. With new people and topics, I still struggle a lot with feeling that way, but I feel increasingly more comfortable in those situations, too. Maybe every bit of comfort has some generalized spread, like every bit of negativity has sometimes seemed to.

If my brain has a hard time knowing what's safe, knowing if I've done enough, then I just have to keep working at what it’s my guess is safe or enough, and appreciate what does feel that way.

The good feelings just crept up on me. I imagine that's how it'll be in the future, too.

Maybe a new understanding of how to help people with OCD/panic/anxiety/etc will come out. Maybe one already has and I don't know about it yet. All I know is that I described has given me some good results, and some of that goodness has been stable and reliable, despite my fears. And, eventually, I’ve started to also *feel* that they’re safe and reliable.

Let’s say I am a terrible person. Whatever. That doesn’t stop me from enjoying a good book, or going on a good run, or doing well in school, or hanging out with my friends. It doesn’t stop me from living in the present moment and using what is ya my disposal right now to do kind things for others. It doesn’t stop me from learning new things and engaging in new hobbies. It doesn’t stop me from resting in the grace and love that I know I have in Christ Jesus. 

So I’m done trying to figure out whether I “deserve” happiness. There’s a whole beautiful world out there for me to experience, and I’m not gonna let OCD or guilt or my past or regrets or whatever it may be hold me captive any longer.

In short, here is what I have to say to OCD:

I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year and I know that does not sound long, and I sound over eager, but we are looking to move in together in the next year or two. I am also looking to buy a new car soon. My parents spoil me and pay for my gas and insurance(two accidents on record, one was minor) They are also going to help $5,000 for the car and I have over $7,000 in savings. They are amazing and helpful and want nothing but good things, but I'm not sure how they will react about moving in with my boyfriend and I don't know how much they will help and how much I will have to start paying for. 

We both currently work part-time jobs and make 9/9.50 an hour (hopefully he will be getting $12 soon) it is really hard to find apartments in this budget. I also know we should both get credit cards to build a good credit score. I am planning to stay with the company I am at until I have a lead in my job field(which is whole other stress post in and of itself). I put 33% of my paycheck in savings and take home around $400 every week. The longer I am at my company ik I will receive raises. I just don't see a point to leave a job that teats me well and recognizes my efforts just for another part time job that will pay me around the same just because it is only slightly in my career field(furniture stores in relation to interior design, I am currently in food).

I am just really anxious about this and I always have to worry about things way before they happen, and I have a rather safe than sorry mentality, especially since this can be a long process.

Literally any adulting advice is welcome. I have hardly any idea what to expect when apartment hunting, we have a friend who has moved out, but he leads a little bit of a different attitude and lifestyle than what we want. We have another couple friend we could ask if they wanted to move in somewhere together, but the area we are looking at is far from where they are and I am unsure of their future plans and  unsure if it is necessarily the best idea.

&#x200B;

Been diagnosed with OCD now for the past 7 years, 

But recently had more and more struggle with the following : 

I have this obsession that I will grasp a metallic pole in the streets or subway, something I totally try to avoid. (mostly because of fear of germs)

Now sometimes I try everything not to do it, but then I FEEL the tactile sensation of having grasped the pole, I can feel the metallic sensation,  the shape of the pole, and the coldness of it. 

&#x200B;

The same happens when I am afraid of grasping a stranger, I sometimes feel after walking past someone, that i clutched their arm, I can feel the fabric of the cloathes on the arm, the warmth of the arm, the shape , etc..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Basically the question here is :   


Can ocd give you VIVID tactile hallucinations??

&#x200B;

 And as I say vivid, I do not mean a tactile sensation like the feeling of dirtiness in germ OCD where you have the urge to wash it or smthg,   
But i mean proper tactile hallucinations as if you really grasped something that wasn't there.  


I hope you'll understand my query,

A lot of time.. And you will fail. You will fail and fail again, and you will feel like you are back to zero again and it will hurt like hell... Sometimes you will fail just for a hour, sometimes for an entire day, or even sometimes for an entire week or more. 
But it doesn't matter.. You have to get back up. 

The battle against OCD is a marathon, not a 100 meter race. The longer you carry on, the better you have a chance to succeed. 

Continue to expose yourself and to train yourself to not to pay attention to your thoughts, to not react.. At the beginning you won't manage to do it at all... Then you will manage to do it 1 out of 100 times, and then 1 out of 30 times... and eventually one day, you will see your obsessions falling one after the other.

But I have to say thatI am not quite there yet but I have seen major improvement in the past 6 months. For example I don't feel this feeling of death after having an intrusive thought. I don't care what it means about me to have these thoughts and I start finding them silly and even funny. I give myself between 6 to 12 extra month to heal completely. That's the key. 

Don't ask for a quick fix or you will get discouraged quickly. That was my main mistake before. But you can't change 15 years of neural pathway over one night. It takes very long time. 1 year or 2.

So give yourself lots of time and don't try to beat it in one day, won't happen. And promise yourself to carry on no matter how many failures you will encounter. 

But be careful here guys.

You dont fight OCD. You make it your bitch. You embrace it.

Take care guys and let's do it. That shit will make every one of us a brutal warrior.",17,0

He is extremely afraid of being dirty and will spend hours washing and roughly scrubbing his body or hands with burning hot water until he is ""clean"". His skin has become chalky white from how dried and cracked they are. If he walks out of the bathroom and accidentally touches the door handle etc, he will start the ritual over again and can't stop himself from performing the cleansing ritual no matter how frustrated and angry he gets or how fatigued he gets. he also has insomnia and nightmares where he wakes up screaming

Recently, he went on a business trip that lasted \~half a year. He came back extremely emaciated and weak. My brother's physique before was extremely lean and muscular, with little to no body fat (he used to dedicate 3.5 hours a day at the gym religiously and also ate like 4k cals a day, and was able to maintain this lifestyle and physique for close to 10 years...prob bc of his OCD). But rn he is 6'3 weighing only 147lb....he lost nearly 100lb bc he stopped eating solid foods to avoid using the bathroom. he is so weak that he can barely walk without the support of a cane or even hold a gallon of water. (my brother is not old enough to be using a cane...he's in his early 30s). We did not recognize him at all when we picked him up from the airport and he purposely stayed MIA while he was away so we had no way of knowing his state of health. I'll attach visuals for before and after comparisons (not his own pictures, but pictures that closely resemble his physique).

As a family, we do not know how to help him. He's an adult and will only do what he wants to do. And becomes very paranoid and agitated if we don't comply (aka wash our hands as well if we touch something ""dirty"", or open the door, pick up his ""dirty"" things etc) and even when we refuse to, he will just keep yelling and go into an episode until you can clearly see in his eyes that he is 1) far gone and 2) deathly afraid of us and the ""germs"". he'll also get extremely frustrated and start throwing things or breaking furniture. He loses all sense of reality. so just flat out saying no doesn't work in his case. And he has started diff treatments a lot of times with a bunch of doctors but none of them resonated with him, and currently, he is fed up with these doctors and treatment since he hasn't seen any results.

But the extreme weight loss is what's really scaring me right now since his health is at such risk. We're forcing him to eat and so far he's complying. I'm desperate in trying to learn how I can help my brother out. We've tried explaining to him that germs are everywhere and on anything and the logic of it all but it doesn't really resonate with him either. he even thinks a bar of soap can be dirty after you touch it with dirty hands and that the water dripping down your body after you scrub it is dirty as well. he has even thrown away the majority of his clothes and things bc of his germaphobia OCD and doesn't let anyone touch him or hug him or sit too close to him. This all escalated within 2 years, and the more you remind him of his OCD or his ""progress"" the more he reverts back to his compulsions. And even though he lives at home, he is the main caretaker of the house in terms of finance and bills despite his OCD (he actually thinks it helps him in his career so that's why he refuses medication as well bc it distracts him from being ultra-observant at work and losing his ""spark"") so completely recking the house/furniture/throwing away bars of soap after a single use/throwing away clothes and buying new ones/any materialistic swap is easy for him and he sees no ""problem"" in it since he can easily replace it or get it repaired without worries. AKA the main problem is that he's an adult and independent so he just flat out doesn't listen to us

Basically something happened over five years ago. The way I always remembered it was that I didn’t really do anything wrong . It was embarrassing at most and no one could’ve gotten hurt . Worst case scenario I slightly pissed my cousin off by trying to be funny. 

Although this was the case I was still fretting about it and felt very guilty . The guilt towards this memory occurred around mid September and finally left about early October. However , about a week ago maybe longer , I was thinking about this memory again which I already felt bad about for whatever reason , and my brain suddenly went ‘did it really go like that , or did this actually happen’ *insert something way worse than the initial memory* and then that was all I could think of for days. I was terrified that what I had done was in fact way worse than what I initially thought and I could’ve not only hurt somebodies feelings but physically hurt them as well through my stupid joke. 

It was only about a day or two ago that I managed to convince myself that this memory was false and life seemed to be on the up. Well that was very short lived since today the doubt has returned and this is all I can think about again . If this did truly happen then I seriously crossed a line. I can’t even convince myself that this isn’t something I would ever do because , 5 years ago , I was a dumb kid. I was not self aware at all and did and said some stupid shit . I’m completely different now but I can’t convince myself that I would never have done this since I was a dumb kid , not nasty but just did things without thinking. 

Whenever I try to tell myself that it cannot be true because that’s never how I remembered it for over 5 years , my brain goes ‘but what if you did remember it this way but just suppressed the memory so much that you forgot how bad it was’ . It’s a never ending loop of self doubt and seeking reassurance. I just need some advice . I’m desperate.",10,0

Build self love, invite pain.",10,juev1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/juev1d/meditation_and_therapy_have_been_of_so_much_help/,3,1605409432.0,"I'll warn you that these are not easy messages or things you may want to do or hear but they are key IMO to healing from ALL unhealthy emotional patterns.

The key ill of almost every unhealthy emotional issue is that we become identified with the problem and put our life on pause to go try to fix or solve it. And then the act of putting our life on pause to do these things is what perpetuates the issue and causes the problem to affect our lives.

The solution is as radical as it is not fun lol. Acceptance and letting go on the one hand, building love and compassion for yourself on the other. Neither of these is in the least easy but both ARE doable! I still struggle daily but am in a much better place now than I have ever been. Ironically 2020 has been one of the best years emotionally for me in many years. Meditation and therapy have been the 2 keys for me.

Meditation has allowed me to see my mind and thoughts as they are. They have given me enough space from my thoughts to realize they ARE thoughts, that I am NOT them. This doesn't mean they don't bother me still but it means that I don't have to be fussed and merged with them. I can allow them to be there in the same way that a cut on my arm can be there. I can feel the pain from the cut, it's not going to go away, but ""I"" am not the cut and not the pain. I can just allow it to be there.

And allowing things to be there is where it all starts. Because once you open up that door you can start to ask yourself, ok what do I want to place my focus on. Cause that shift is where the progress all lies. What do you want your days and your life in general to look like? That is where to put your focus on your mental energy. The brain stuff and intrusive thoughts you can just invite along for the ride. Approach it all with curiosity and agree with your mind. OK mind yes everyone hates me and I'm a murderer and this is really painful right now, yes I'm a horrible human being, now how am I going to go about my day so that I feel proud of how I handled it anyway? It's when we allow the random shit of the brain to have control of the steering wheel of our life that we really get in trouble.

Honestly a lot of this is about inviting pain and suffering into our lives. That may sound strange cause you might say but my OCD IS all about pain and suffering, that's all I do. But likely that is because you have spent your life trying to avoid pain and suffering and your brain has then thrown up a million and one things now that it must check and avoid in order to make sure that you are good, perfect, that bad things won't happen. Truth is no such thing exists. Bad things are going to happen and we have to learn to accept and invite them and build up our life so that we realize when the really shitty things happen hey I can survive that and I'm actually stronger for it. Bring it on shitty world, bring it on!!!

Another thing is, take action! OCD is about fear of uncertainty and loss of control. As soon as you feel that drive to go to some compulsion, get up and go do something instead (obviously not the compulsion lol). And by do something I don't mean check your phone lol. I mean do something engaging, something fulfilling. And speaking of checking your phone, that is something else to cut out. We think our OCD is all about the horrible thoughts in our heads but it's actually about the million and one little other things we do when we don't quite feel right. ""Must check FB again"", ""hmm I wonder if I got a like on my post"", ""did my phone just buzz""? ""did I just make a mistake at work""? No, these are the FIRST things to cut out.

Lastly build self love and kindness. This is our job and no one else's. It's great when others validate and love and accept us but this is not a guarantee sadly even as we are all universally deserving of love and acceptance. Yes that is a radical statement but it is true. But no one else can save you, let go of those weights for you, forgive you for being human. That is a job we must undertake ourselves. It is also a job we are oh so worthy of. We are all flawed, beautiful beings all the more wonderful for being broken (every thing on this planet is broken and imperfect).",10,0

She literally just mumbled an apology and left the room and then I had to run to the bathroom to cry and did do a compulsion to calm myself down but I’m so proud of myself for actually standing up for myself to an authority figure, which I’ve only been able to manage to do a few times in my life.

I went to therapy for a short amount of time and got better. Then around age 16 I started obsessing over having a heart attack, I would check my pulse every couple hours, google symptoms for hours, and became hype aware of my body signals. At age 17 I convinced myself I had a brain tumor. Even with all that going on my biggest obsession was that one day I was going to go crazy, for a long time I would repeat my name and address in my mind just to make sure I wasn’t going crazy because I read somewhere that when you lose touch with reality you don’t know who you are. 

After those bouts of obsession I was pretty anxiety free from 18-22. Then one night I ate way too many marijuana edibles and had a horrible trip. During the trip I convinced myself I was going crazy. I kept repeating in my head “okay this is it I’ve gone crazy.” The day after I started to feel really depersonalized and anxious. I was watching a TV show that night and someone in the show was schizophrenic, that led me to google schizophrenia symptoms and bam I became obsessed with it. I became obsessed with going crazy and hearing voices. I started having really bad intrusive thoughts, anxiety, and panic. This has been going on for about 2 years now, I’m currently 24. I’ve spent hours googling schizophrenia symptoms and reading stories, when I read about a new story my mind will try to mimic whats going on. For example I read that a guy’s schizophrenia started when he though his food was being poisoned so I started thinking “what if I think my foods poisoned?” And that triggers my anxiety. It’s a vicious cycle. 

Sorry for the rant and the wall of text, just wondering if anyone has this obsession or a similar story, thanks.",14,0

It all seems to be caused by my brain's image of myself in my head. my subconscious assumes that I am somehow a manipulative, cocky, narcissistic person, even though such traits violate my deepest beliefs about myself. It's as if my brain looks at me like the very thing I hate, and actually visualizes me that way.

when I fail, my brain tells me that i was cocky and that i deserved that. it tells me that I thought i was going to succeed, even when in reality I didn't.

when I succeed at anything, my brain tells me that I didnt deserve it, and if i feel any joy in my praise or success, even an ounce of happiness my brain screams at me.

when i open up about my issues, like right now, my brain tells me that im too strong and cocky of a person to do so, even though I don't actually see myself this way. I cant let myself realize that its my OCD because sometimes my brain tells me Im faking it or that im using it as an excuse.

When i try to be my normal self, my brain tells me that I'm faking not being a narcissist or that I'm putting on a mask because i like my real personality and my brain tells me that its fake and a tool for manipulating people. Instead of being myself, in normal conversation im trying to keep down intrusive thoughts and i often come off as serious, disinterested, or even panicked (or at least i think i come off that way, that could be my OCD telling me that.

its gotten to the point where I \*literally see myself in the mirror\* and hate the person I see. Im trapped inside of constant rumination in my mind and i cant escape the image

If you are questioning whether it is OCD or denial you are already trying to answer a question that cannot be answered. No matter how much proof you have that it’s OCD, your brain will always fight back with more and more torment. 

This is a message for everyone but also for myself, since I constantly agonize over whether this is OCD or not. Even as I’m typing this now my brain is telling me that I’m in denial and this isn’t OCD.

It does not matter if you have OCD or not. What matters is that we must learn to not let our minds and our thoughts control our feelings, lives, etc. That sounds easier said than done but it is really the only way we can go back to truly LIVING our lives. 

Some common fears are:

“What if I’m using OCD to not deal with the fact that I’m actually xyz?”

“What if I am end up becoming xyz later on in life?”

“What if therapy actually exposes the fact that I DO enjoy these thoughts?”

These fears are holding you back from getting the actual help that you need. Whether you think you’re gay, a pedophile, a murderer, a sociopath, schizophrenic, we all suffer from OCD. We’re all stuck in an obsessive-compulsive cycle that is only hurting us. 

So what if you are in denial? Do you think you’re gonna be able to solve it in a day? In an hour? By thinking about it every single second of the day?  
 You have to take the leap of faith and BE UNCERTAIN. 

Tell yourself “If I have OCD, then I will get the help I need, if I am actually xyz, then I will get the help I need but I am not going to try to solve it right now.”

Even if it feels so real and you’re convinced that this time it’s actually real and not OCD take that leap of faith and be uncertain. We first have to not let our thoughts control us and then we will gain more clarity within ourselves.

Hi guys!

I’ve been battling Pure OCD (specifically HOCD and ROCD) for the past 7-8 months and have been starting to get glimmers of hope everyday. We’ve all been there, having suicidal ideations, thoughts of it lasting FOREVER, and whatnot. As a survivor of such, I know and will be prepared for a relapse if there will ever be one in the future thanks to a multitude of self-therapy (CBT, ACT and ERP), meditation, exercise and reading books about purpose and hope! Amidst the stories of sadness and despair, here I am to carve out a shining story to motivate you guys further! Never took medication since I was pretty fearful with it altering my brain’s composition btw!

Just a background of myself, I’m currently 20 years old and have had one of the best first 20 years of success as an individual (breaking a multitude of business records here in my country, winning multiple awards as an entrepreneur, breaking records in my respective Rotary Clubs, have put up at least 3 businesses worth 7 digits in terms of USD valuation and am about to finish my degree, possibly getting Latin Honors in the process). Inherently speaking, I thought I could handle just about anything and was projected to retire at 25, having loved a life many wish to live at my age. However, OCD struck me and the tables started turning. For the first time in my whole life, I actually wanted to commit suicide and not live anymore, because of the agony this disorder has caused me. This made me believe that NO MATTER how talented, smart, great or amazing you are as an individual, mental illnesses will continue to rear its head with no avail. 

It’s been 2-3 months of continuous success with this anxiety disorder, and I can wholeheartedly say that ACT Therapy is one of the most under-appreciated forms of therapy, and I will wield its teachings throughout my whole life. ERP is also a beneficial factor in such as it helps shape one’s perspective with this debilitating disease. Radical acceptance and mindfulness continue to shape my life in a multitude of ways, and I’ve only had 10-15 intrusive thoughts per day, sometimes none,  as compared to 300s of them before. I finally get to experience the calmness of life again. With this said, I plan to reinforce the beliefs of my country with regards to mental health, and will put up a public psych ward or clinic in the near future in order to aid those who experience debilitating mental issues like this, predominantly OCD which is clearly not as understood as many others out there. 

There are days I still experience pangs of anxiety but am starting to love myself again, knowing that one cannot inherently be perpetually happy as an individual! Thanks guys and will be going out of this sub for the mean time whilst I’m recovering, but can say that I’m around the 90% mark already. There are times I wonder if I really loved her or if I genuinely have OCD haha, but as everybody here knows, we’re all NOT SURE hehe!

Here are some of my tips

- ACT is f*cking life-changing + ERP (be consistent with it); The Happiness Trap has been amazing for me! Use all 6 processes consistently!
- Make new habits, check “The Atomic Habits” by James Clear!
- Exercise everyday! 30 mins of exercise is great
- Meditate now. Seriously. I use the Waking Up app by Sam Harris and it’s been such a great awakening in terms of my well-being as an individual!
- Read books, especially Man’s Search for Meaning, for those wondering if life still has meaning
- NO checking, reassurance, compulsions! AVOID all that crap
- Journaling has been great, and following Marcus Aurelius’ practices have been really helpful!
- Embrace uncertainty my friends
- I plan to take inositol soon for OCD, just to minimize its effects abruptly",22,0

I'd pay someone to kill me. I'd do anything. I'm scared of what comes after though, I want to just ""be"".

It’s been something I’ve been doing for a bit, I would write a sentence and look over it, then write again, and then look over it again. People just say let your pen flow when you’re writing but now I think I’ve convinced my brain to think that every sentence  that I read or write look/sound weird, so now when I write/read some sentences, it feels like it doesn’t make any sense. This is new too, so it isn’t a thing that’s been happening for a while. I use to be able to just write a whole page without even checking to see if my sentence structure was good or bad. I just didn’t care, but now it’s to the point where I’ve convinced myself that my sentences sound weird/off so I read them multiple times to see if it’s correct, and sometimes it feels like my brain doesn’t register the sentence it just makes the sentence look confusing. I’m guessing since I’ve questioned myself so much when writing, that my brain questions every sentence I read as well. I don’t know what this could be but I’m guessing it’s OCD because I’ve had different mental compulsions in the past. P.S this paragraph took me 15 minutes to write because I had to check one sentence that sounded off. I just wanted to point that out as an example. And one more thing, I also question other people’s sentences when I read them too.

“Dear one, 
All the things you’re feeling are valid. First of all, it’s okay to be feeling scared. That fear is not silly or stupid. It is valid. Second, there’s no shame in how much time you spent on the internet yesterday. Remember that you have a mental illness. Do you feel shame for trying new ways of relieving your pain when you’re sick with a cold? No. You were looking for comfort, and you can see today in the light of a new day, that those things didn’t work. There is no shame in that. 

You are a human looking for ways to come back to yourself while feeling lost and overwhelmed with fear. Today you are coming back home to yourself. There is no shame. Welcome home.”",23,0

Constantly taking notes is my way of trying to rid myself of excessive/repetitive thoughts and find some peace in my mind. I can’t really rest until I’ve done it.

It's been a tough year for many, me included, but I just moved into a new apartment in a new city, and the idea of a fresh start has given me enough energy and hope to push past the intrusive thoughts for a (record breaking!) two weeks. 

But then I woke up in the middle of the night and convinced myself that I did something horrible. It's so horrible that I don't want to say it, but I'm sure that people on this sub can imagine the caliber of horror when it comes to the lies that OCD tells us. Anyway, I started trying to reassure myself and managed to go back to sleep. But now I've been awake for four hours and have gotten nothing from my to-do list done. Instead, I've sunk deep into a rabbit hole of crappy reality TV shows and their subreddits. When my productivity app would tell me I'd been on reddit for too long, I'd snooze it because it just felt like a reminder that I can't escape/disbelieve the intrusions unless I'm immersed in my phone.

I just want to leave all this behind. I'm not formally employed, and my income depends directly on how much work I get done. I haven't made money in a very long time. I have to unpack my apartment. I have to be a better, more reliable partner. There are so many things I need to do. But my constant need to convince myself that I didn't commit a horrible crime is stopping me from doing anything. Reading about the petty drama from the cast of shows like Teen Mom is the only thing that helps me. Why can't getting my work done, exercising, or doing necessary chores help me?

I wasted a lot of time in the thoughts. Time that will not come back. This are tips that I have gathered from my experience, they might work for you they might don’t. If they dont work, feel free to reach out to me. I understand you, I know the pain. I went to all of my school years with this shit in my brain. I’m no psicologist but I know very well the pain. Well this are the tips:

All the thoughts and sensations are happening inside our heads. We have to be clear of this. I recommend to you all to write the thoughts down in a piece of blank paper and burn it.

We don’t have special powers that predict what is going to happen in the future or that we can change the future. Our brains believe we do. One cannot know the future with 100% probability. Your thoughts might happen but don’t associate the fact that they happen because you didn’t do the compulsions because that’s just a lie your brain tells you. Remember that your brain is torturing you and will keep going on and on for an excuse for you to continue doing the compulsions.

Don’t search for the right moment to stop having the thoughts. If you are reading this, fetch the paper right away and burn the thoughts away. You shouldn’t trust all that your brain says. Your brain is trying to torture you. Be aware of the present moment every time you can, try mindfulness meditation.

Be aware that you can control what you think. Look at the floor for a second, and then close your eyes and think only of the floor. You can. Be very mindful of this.identify the instrusive thoughts and tell them to fuck themselves, don’t turn this into a compulsion. If it’s already turning into a compulsion. Breath in and out and relax.

Relax, just relax. You don’t actually have to do anything your intrusive thoughts say. You just have to relax and do what you like.

OCD tends to make you feel that all things you do are meaningless; they are not. Enjoy your life. Enjoy the time you have. Write what you did in the day. Be mindful that your life is passing away every single second.Start to enjoy life

A very positive thing of having OCD is that when you finally are aware that all the thoughts are happening inside your head and you can actually relax. All thing in life become a lot more easier. We have that advantage that other people don’t have. We actually suffered every single day with anxiety or stress, when we don’t we enjoy it a lot more.

Be aware that your mind is sick. Don’t trust every single thing it says. Relax and identify the compulsions and intrusive thoughts and sensations. Relax, this is the most important of all, relax. You don’t have to feel anxiety, stress and pain every day of your life. Just relax.Have a nice day.",20,0

I have severe OCD which manifests with the worst themes imaginable.(21F)

Recently I went through something traumatic and it was like something snapped inside me. My OCD went haywire and the thoughts now come in non-stop. I started going to therapy and in the second session I broke down and told the psychologist about the content of these thoughts. 

Her reaction was good and it gave me temporary relief. At first she asked me questions about whether I’ve ever acted on these thoughts and I said no. She then assured me that I am not what I think I am and gave me advice on how to deal with the thoughts. 

But now I’m panicking. I feel like I’ve now exposed myself. I’m wondering whether one day this information could be leaked although she has assured me that she has no right to share it with a third party unless she believes I may harm myself or someone else. What if she secretly thinks I may harm someone? 

She has a personal and private iPad where she writes notes which she says that no one ever sees. They are just for her own memory. But I’m scared there’s a secret mental health file where everything I’ve said is being recorded. Or what if I can’t travel anymore because other countries can see this information and they reject or arrest me?

I’m scared that my future employers will find out or society will find out and I’ll be shamed and rejected forever. To make things worse, I suffer from real event OCD where I think I’ve done something wrong even though deep down I know I’m innocent. So I had a huge real event OCD compulsion and told her that there are things that I haven’t confessed to her. She didn’t ask me for any confessions or elaboration on this. But I feel like I dug myself a deeper hole by saying this.

I'm currently 18 years old, soon to be 19 and my life is absolutely miserable at the moment.

My earliest recollection of anxiety and possibly OCD is when I was about 10 or 11 years old. It was almost as if a switch was flicked in my brain as prior to this time, I was a happy, active child as far as I can remember.

I started to analyse and stress about an event that took place earlier in that year. It involved another person and although what happened was not necessarily even a bad or negative thing, at the time I thought it was the worst thing that I could have done, I recall comparing myself to murderers when in reality, I can almost guarantee if I told anyone what the event was, the reaction would be nowhere near as severe as mine. I would worry about it from the moment I woke up, to the moment i went to sleep with an immense amount of guilt.

I made myself believe that I didnt deserve any form of happiness because of what I had done. Anything positive that occurred in my life at this time would just be negated by this event. 

Alongside this, I would start worrying about trivial, ridiculous things. I would also have to do things an even number amount of times, either 2 or 4 or I believed something bad would happen. I would have to bounce on the trampoline 4 times before I got off, open and shut the door 4 times before leaving the house, etc.

As I grew up I become extremely anxious if I ever had to come into contact with semen, urine, feces or my own genitals for that matter. This would be followed by extensive and excessive hand washing.

Around this time, severe, violent and disgusting intrusive thoughts infected me. At a young age, these thoughts were EXTREMELY troubling. I was miserable.

Eventually these thoughts because alot less prevalent, due to me just accepting them and not giving them the power that they crave. I still experience these sorts of thoughts occasionally, however I really couldn't care less about them, I just try to laugh at them.

As life went on I continued to suffer silently, worrying about various different things. Emotional and anger problems stated to arise. I became a very angry person and would get extremely agitated and furious over small things. I still am quite an angry person, and have difficulty controlling my anger in some instances.

As high school started I became slightly happier and less anxious overall, however my contamination OCD was still very prevalent. However it transitioned from worrying about illnesses to just not being able to handle the feeling of certain things or people on me. An example of this would be shaking hands, I wasnt at all concerned about getting sick or anything bad happening. I knew nothing would happen. I just couldn't stand the feeling of having that person ""on me"".

I went through school not caring about my school work at all.

Between ages 13 and 16, I continued to experience moderate contamination OCD and would obsess over specific events, that would end up in the same thought process as the earlier event I wrote about. Although I was struggling, I was still relatively functional and things were not overly bad.

It wasn't until I went to a party when I was 16 that things really took a turn for the worse. I decided I was going to drink to excess as this party and so I did. I got extremely drunk to the point of blackout. Over the next few days I started to think about what happened at this party, and I became very anxious that I couldn't remember certain parts of the night. Because i couldn't remember, I made myself believe that I had raped someone. Now there is absolutely no way that I would ever do such a thing, nor did I have any interest in having sex in general due to my contamination OCD, but because I couldn't remember the night, I thought ""well, if I cant remember then who's to say it didnt happen? It must of"". 

For me this kind of thought process kind of sums up my OCD, if theres even a chance that somethings happened, no matter how small then it MUST have happened and this goes for lots of things relating to my contamination fears.

For months I made myself believe I was a rapist. I knew that it wasnt true, but at the same time the OCD part of my brain wouldn't let me see reason. The guilt and angst I experienced during this time is indescribable. During this time, I thought I was FILTHY, I washed myself and hands constantly, it was almost as if I could feel the act of ""rape"" on me and I was almost trying to wash it off, I'm not sure.

As you can imagine, I refused to allow happiness or joy in my life, every day all day consisted of convincing myself I was one of the worst people on earth and like I said earlier, no matter what happened, no matter how positive - it would always come back to me telling myself I never deserve to be happy again.

Eventually I came to the conclusion that I obvioisly didnt  commit the horrible act and would never do such a thing. Although I just transitioned my focus onto something else that could have happened at that party because of the lack of memory. 

Even after I realised that what I believed was untrue, my contamination OCD and hand washing still controlled my life.

Fast forward about 6 months, I went to a small get together with 4 friends and got quite drunk. Different thoughts, same results for months.

Eventually I stopped going to school because I hated my life and had 0 motivation for everything.

Like I said earlier, my contamination OCD and hand washing were not due to germs or concern of illness, but just general distress ans disgust over the thought of certain objects or people somehow getting on me, especially the people from the 2 parties mentioned. An example of this would be if I were to touch a public toilet, I would be unbelievably anxious, but not due to germs, just due to thought of anything from that toilet being transferred onto me, my skin, hands, arms, face etc. This thought process can be applied to every aspect of my contamination OCD and almost always comes back to the people, places or things from those events.

Fast forward to the past year, my life has been absolute hell. I wish I was dead almost every single day of my life.

I have spoken to physcolgoists, physciatrists but nothing has helped.

I have been unable to go anywhere, do anything. All I've been able to do is wake up, have showers and wash my hands for upto 6 hours a day and I despise every second of it, it is horrible. 

Other than washing myself, my days have consisted of isolating myself in my room on my computer doing absolute nothing, other then playing video games, watching television and extreme anxiety and hatred for myself and life in general.

I have been experiencing what I would describe anger panic attacks. When something goes wrong in my rituals, washing procedures and avoidance techniques I  get so anxious and angry to the point where I just cannot calm down.

2 months ago, my mother called an ambulance on me. In Australia when a mental health call is made, the police also must attend. So I had two paramedics and 4 police officers enter my house without my knowledge. Now I can barely leave my house to go into my own backyard, and can barely go near my own mother. Now having 6 people that work in these sectors enter my house without my knowledge it was extremely distressing. For obvious reasons I didnt want to open my door to my room. 

They threatened that they would break the door down if I didnt open it and come with them. I reluctantly opened it and they ""sectioned"" me under the mental health act. This means that I was forced to go to CAMPBELLTOWN hospital with them and was not allowed to leave.

 Once I was arrived I was around 9PM and was put in the emergency room with a designated security guard on me, so that I wouldn't leave. As you can imagine, I was unbelievably anxious and humiliated by this whole situation. 

Now I cannot think of a worse way to handle someone with severe OCD, who can barely exit their own room (and they knew this). Then to forcibly remove them ans put them through what I'm about to describe.

The way this specific hospital handles mental health is  nothing short of disgusting. 

Now apparently it was so important and urgent that I was taken to this hospital and yet I was told there was no physcologist or physciatrist at the hospital and wouldn't he until the morning, I couldn't believe my fucking ears.

During this time I watched police bring in several people, one of which tried to run away because of how they were being treated and were subsequently tackled to the ground and dragged across the floor back into the room, who was then in tears for over an hour, with almost no compassion from anyone, intact I overheard the main security guard refer to this person as ""It"". This person repedeadelty asked to be seen by a doctor or a nurse and no one came.

After 4-5 traumatic hours of STANDING in an emergency room without being able to even go outside to get fresh air I was eventually put into this disgusting mental health room in the emergency department, which had one bed in the middle of the room with nothing else in it, except the sight of the filthy walls. It reminded me of the movies contsining those disgusting dingy physch wards. Now the only reason they gave me this room was because I had a back problem and was in physical pain, otherwise I would have been forced to stay out in the emergency room for fuck knows how long with a security guard watching me at all times.

By the time I was given this disgusting room, it would have been 2am. I was so anxious and I couldn't bring myself to actually lie down due to fear of contamination, so I sat on it, awake all night. I was told the physcologist or physciatrist would be In at 8am and they would assess me, I begged to be seen ASAP and I was expecting to be released, as there was absolutely no reason or benefit to staying in this hell hole. Not sure if they did this in spite of me or what, but I was not seen until 12pm, by this time I had rang my father and he came and was sitting in the room with me. 

This person was one of the most incompetent people I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to. I explained my situation and how extremely hard being here was for me, aswell as my Dad saying that I could come back and stay with him if released.

I was told that I was not allowed to leave. I was absolutely devastated, I have never felt so absolutely helpless. No matter what I did, no matter what I said, nothing would change the fact that I was stuck there. I have never experienced this feeling before in my whole life and I had already witnessed what happened to people that tried to escape..... It is a prison.

Not only was I forced to stay, but also directly ignored by a mental health ""professional"" when asking questions, they didnt even look at me.

I had to stay in this fucking prison cell for another day with 0 doctors and 0 help.

 The next day they transferred to the mental health section of the hospital where I was forced to stay for another 3 days. During this time I wasnt seen by anyone apart from when I was being assessed on my final day of being there. The only ""help"" that was offered during this time was to just drug me. That was their solution and that was the reality of this entire traumatic experience - offer absolutely no help, put me through some of the most stressful things for OCD, drug me, diagnose what had already been diagnosed and eventually release me in a worse state then I was previously. Truly disgusting.

My life currently consists of analysing every single aspect of my life, finding the negative in every possible scenario and constantly being anxious about absoluey everything. I cant even touch things in my own house without washing my hands, I have to use tissues ans gloves to touch anything. I go through on average 1L of liquid soap and 3 tissue boxes per day. Currently I am extremely depressed, with the misery growing each day.

I am now more actively seeing physcolgoists, gps (FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THE HOSPITAL MENTIONED) who seem quite helpful and positive and are helping me to hopefully improve my life.

Although this a very long post, this is only a brief summary of some of the things I've been going through. Thank you so much to anyone that has read through this, I really appreciate it.

To anyone that's going through something similar, dont make my mistakes and get help as soon as possible. Take control of this thing before it takes control of you.

To anyone who has been struggling with this and hasn't found any success or improvement as of yet. Please dont give up.

If anyone has any questions at all, please ask as I would love to answer them or if anyone would like to generally just talk with someone who's going through something similar, please dont hesitate to post it here, or message me personally. I would love to try and help in any way I can.

I used to get POCD intrusive thoughts and images sometimes, but they weren't that bad and I had different obsessions consuming me at the time. When I actually started working with kids and learning more about OCD they faded away completely because I knew with more certainty that I would never harm a child or want to and intrusive thoughts are things that repulse us. I haven't worked with kids since the summer though, and I guess some recent stressers made me vulnerable. Next thing I know I've lost like 3 days to obsessively researching paraphilia and pedophilia and sexual fantasies and statistics and answering questionnaires and running experiments on myself because OH NO WHAT IF I AM? It's crazy how I can fall into these traps and not realize it's just freaking OCD again. 

I'm so distressed, it's so scary. I can't believe I actually started to fall for it.

I am diagnosed OCD recently but I have a list of symptoms that are very ""ADHD"". I am also a 22 year old woman and I know it's common not to get diagnosed when you're a woman. 

Below is my list of symptoms that I think might be related to ADHD. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow to discuss this more. I just know ADHD and OCD are considered opposite ends of the spectrum so I'm not sure. 

Sensory issues: 

Cannot touch pure cotton

Can’t touch anything when my fingers are pruned, have a hard time doing the dishes or taking long showers, being in the pool for a while

Cannot wear turtle necks or anything too close or tight to my neck

Can’t stand the feeling of the seam on socks or tags in underwear 

Constant desire to touch and run my fingers through things, specifically bed sheets etc

ADHD: 

I get easily distracted while working. I’ll be in the middle of a work task and google a random thought or start to do a completely unrelated task. I’m either very focused or I get distracted a lot 

I have very poor balance, constantly bumping into walls and tables

I have a hard time focusing on what people are saying when they’re talking to me unless it’s of high interest to me, I also have a hard time retaining information, I often forget details friends tell me and I feel horrible about it. I finish people’s sentences for them (only people I’m close with though)

I have a hard time playing certain games or watching youtube videos, my attention span is very low and I want to do everything fast as possible

I can’t listen to new music or new tv shows or movies unless I'm watching it with someone else who wants to watch it. I watch the same tv show over and over because it’s comfortable 

Had a very hard time starting and finishing papers in school, if I didn't feel the burst of motivation to write it was like I literally could not do it. I never read any of the textbooks unless I was searching for a specific answer. 

Always relating things to myself in conversations

Always moving around in chair and fidgeting with things, chronic nail picking(I know this is OCD but could be both)

Object permeance, if I put my phone where it's not obviously in sight I think I've lost it(even if I've put it there like a minute ago, my brain forgets)

When the situation seems dire we shall smile even wider, because we actively trust that we know the difference.

We know that there are situations when we must be cautious and when our thoughts have merit.  There are situations when we must take active measures to address the conflicts that  will inevitably surface within our lives. Those situations will also produce alarms, but to these alarms we will respond actionably because we are actively recognizing the difference.

OCD fools us once, it fools us twice, and the quality of our life pays the price. It's a powerful monster that, fortunately will lose its bite as soon as we trust we know the difference.

We've all been there many times, paralyzed by the implications of our racing thoughts. We question our values, we question our intentions, we fear the consequences that are being presented to us. We can and will find our mobility when we pause and rejoice. We ignore these thoughts and let them diffuse because we, trust we know the difference.

Our OCD produces thoughts that provide no alternatives, no room for debate. Our anxiety builds and our reality fades, and all seems hopeless, until we trust we know the difference.

To fight those painful moments we must smile and rejoice, we must exorcize this demon by letting the happiness grow and grow and grow. The happiness that results from the fact that, we do indeed know the difference.

Thoughts are omnipresent and are generated at a rate over a thousand a minute. We will always be processing our thoughts.  But we can bury the irrational thoughts and save our energy for our rational thoughts when we, decide that we know the difference.",13,0

it caused me to have my first suicide attempt at 14. i couldn’t bear it anymore, and i tried overdosing on my parents medication. luckily my parents found the pill bottles missing, and it saved my life. i feel so lucky to be here now, for sure.

there were so many things i took for granted before i had ocd. before ocd i didn’t have to worry about going outside with a mask because i thought the air was contaminated. i was able to enjoy trips without constantly being bombarded with intrusive thoughts. i could actually focus on conversations. i could drink and eat normally. the list goes on.

a few months ago, my doctor prescribed me luvox (and later prescribed risperidone for the intrusive thoughts). it completely changed me. for years i had been trying medication, and i didn’t expect this one to work differently - but it did. after a few weeks, my ocd symptoms were almost completely gone, other than the intrusive thoughts. but they were lessened, and im able to deal with them now.

no more drinking a certain amount of sips from a soda. no more closing doors over and over again. no more stepping back and forth and looking like a fool to friends. im a witch, and for years, my ocd prevented me from practicing my craft. i can finally be me now.

913,"The Post to End Pure O, read this",11,ljoo3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ljoo3o/the_post_to_end_pure_o_read_this/,10,1613310434.0,"This is my view on HOCD and other Types of Pure O, why it exists and why it persists. I dont want to reassure people, I just want to suggest a more effective way to recover. Might help a few people. 

Ok so, how come theres something like a loss of libido and attraction for females and false attraction to guys while struggling with HOCD? This is the worst part about HOCD because it attacks something so fundamental to your Identity: your masculine self image and self esteem. Which is locked in its low place by an unresolved shame. If you feel ashamed, you'll never be able to get your self esteem and your attraction to woman back. Shame is the opposite of healthy self esteem.

I don't think simply exposure and response prevention alone is the best solution for HOCD, because it only focuses on the Anxiety the thoughts cause, the internalized shame that caused Pure O in the first place, will remain. Shame is the optimal milieu for compulsive mental and physical actions to take place. So lets say a defeated wolf would normally submit itself to the wolf that it has been defeated by. It would get ranked down in the society or it would have to leave to not get killed. Shame is a great survival strategy but its meant to only persist for a short time. In us humans, the shame reaction can become chronic and lead to a variety of mental illnesses. Shame is a very uncomfortable feeling we would normally try to get rid of as fast as possible by taking a physical action.
I think everyone here whos struggling with HOCD has an unresolved shame that you are compulsively trying to get rid of, by doing absolutely fruitless actions. Shame gets really bad if it can only resolve by changing something that involves yourself. Pure O and Body Dismorphic Disorder for example have alot in common, the one involves the mind and the other the body. They're both reperative drives to get rid of the internalized shame and get back to the normal healthy self esteem. We are all designed to take action when shame occurs, people with HOCD try to carry out a physical action in the mind (mental compulsions) to get rid of the shame. Pure O is a malfunction of the brain to get rid of the no longer needed shame because it has been in the shame state for so long, it forgot how to do it. All of you, we all have no fucking reason to even spend time on this subreddit. If you're not about to get shot, you dont need shame. All you're doing is trying to ensure yourself that nothing is wrong with you so you can let go of the shame. Doesn't really matter what the topic is to resolve the Shame as long as it involves making a change to yourself or trying to assure yourself that you're not a certain way. If you could really assure yourself you're straight, what topic would be your new HOCD next?
Everything, TOCD, HOCD, POCD, HARM OCD... all exist because of an unresolved shame that you're trying to resolve by doing mental compulsions to assure yourself you're not a certain way. 

So I think HOCD can ONLY really take a grip on you if you are in this shamed low self esteem state. Think about it. What has happened to you in your past that crushed your self esteem? Was it bullying, did a loved one push you away? Did something bad happen in your childhood? Did you get embarrassed by someone? Do you feel guilty for something? Do you actually know how it is to feel good about yourself? Have you ever experienced it?
If so, do you still remember the feeling of being assertive and not ashamed? 


This is the thing: If you for example would have an Obsession with hand washing, ERP would work very well, because theres only fear and no chronic shame with this condition.


REGULAR OCD EXISTS TO RESOLVE FEAR


PURE O EXISTS TO RESOLVE SHAME


You can think about Fear and Shame being best buddies, Fear is punching you and Shame is having you in a headlock. Fear convices you to be gay(or something else) and shame blames you for getting convinced, therefore making it urgent to start arguing with Fear again to maybe win the Discussion this time. But it never works. Attacking Fear alone doesn't help for the most part, shame is the one that is always telling us to go back to argue with the Fear so we loose again. Its an endless circle that reinforces itself and makes sure your self esteem remains at rock bottom.




So what to do? Telling Shame to Piss off aswell, because hes maybe even a bigger asshole than Fear. 
-You will most likely need another person to recover. Build a trusting relationship and express your emotions. Get help at challenging internalized beliefs that caused your shame and thus made it possible for HOCD to develope (body image, feelings of worthlessness, inferiority, childhood trauma...). If your problem involves body image for example, you maybe should do some sports and get a bit fitter to give yourself a reason to feel different about yourself.
Remember: The original situation that made it possible for HOCD to get a grip on you was one that destroyed your ego and shamed you. HOCD is just trying to repair your broken self image and finally make the shame state piss off. But it will never succeed at reassuring you absolutely that everything is fine. Only you yourself can do that by telling Fear to shut up and by telling shame that he can stop now making you do mental parcour. 
You have to not let intrusive thoughts additionally shame you.
Adopt a stoic stance to these thoughts, let them pass, show no resistance. Don't let them grab you. 
It might be hard with something so terrifying and incompatible with your self image, but the key is to not let the thoughts and false feelings make you feel ashamed.
Do some exposure, if a thought pops up, just shrug it off or say: yes, probably gay af. (Look for some good ERP techniques.)

Hope this helped some of you",11,0

I feel like if I don’t disclose any transgressions I’ve made in my past, or since knowing them, then I’m a totally dishonest liar who doesn’t deserve love. (Logical me knows this isn’t true, but OCD me tries to convince me that it is.)

Anyhow, I am currently in a new relationship (about two months in, but we had about a month or so of getting to know each other/courtship). I’ve managed to keep my confession compulsion at bay this far. How?

When I feel that anxiety, that urges to spill my guts to my newfound love and tell her all the bad I’ve ever done so that she can see the “real me” and decide if she wants to be with me or not. I ask myself this:

Would I want to hear the same things from her? Or would it just upset me? If she told me about some sexual thing from her past, it would just make me uncomfortable. If she told me she found someone else attractive it would hurt me. If she told me she was still chatting with someone else when we first met, it would just make me feel insecure. 

NOT BECAUSE ANY OF THESE THINGS ARE WRONG OR WOULD MAKE HER A BAD PERSON, BUT BECAUSE I SIMPLY DONT NEED TO HEAR THEM. 

I’m just using these as examples of some of the ridiculous things I’ve confessed to previous partners or gotten the urge to confess. 

We all have things we’ve done that we aren’t proud of, and we will likely continue to do or say things we aren’t proud of. 

But please, next time you have the urge to confess what a “monster” you are to your partner. Ask yourself that question. What purpose would it serve your relationship? And would you REALLY want to hear the same from your partner? 

Good luck, friends. Nurture your relationships, don’t sabotage them by giving in to OCD.

I accepted uncertainty. I lived with questions. Some even had me curious.

Now I feel like a toddler. The simplest things give me anxiety like studying, improving myself, reading, work etc. I start asking myself questions and get completely stressed out. I deal with a lot of existential and moral OCD.

I don't really work anymore. I haven't studied for months. I hide and play games or watch TV inside to avoid life. To avoid responsibility. To avoid even the things I used to love to do. Please believe me, I don't want to. I do it to hide from the world. To protect myself from myself.

I fantasize about death a lot. I'm not planning on killing myself but I think about it A LOT. I'm **not** suicidal but I just really look forward to my life ending. The blankness. The peace. The carelessness. I almost crave it. However I have no plans to kill myself and I don't want anyone to think I do.

I don't want children a family or a gf. I'm not even close to being able to be ok with that.

However, I don't want anyone to think you can't have those things with OCD. You **absolutely** can and if that's what you want I'm really happy for you. I really really am. It's just not for me. I don't want it to be.

article one: (the quote is from here.) https://manhattancbt.com/archives/1471/pocd-arousal/ 

article two: https://www.madeofmillions.com/articles/whats-going-ocd-arousal

-

""Physiological sexual arousal, if one attempts to categorize it, falls somewhere between an expression of desire and a physical reflex. It’s not quite either. Sometimes people feel sexual arousal for someone and it’s not reflected in a genital response. Sometimes people have a physiological (genital) response and they do not feel desire. This is a known and researched phenomenon called arousal non concordance. When we associate something with sex, that can be sufficient to create some genital arousal even in the absence of sexual desire.

People who suffer from POCD are often quite consumed with the fear that they are attracted to children. An unintended side effect of this fear is that they come to associate children with sex and sexual desire — even though they don’t have this desire.""

- 

though my obsessions are mostly violent in nature, i have had pocd intrusive thoughts, and groinal responses in responses to those thoughts as well as sexual trauma (im a csa survivor). finding out what arousal non concordance was made me feel less like a freak for having these responses.

I did get a job, a well paying one actually about a month ago and I had a few internal meltdowns that I had to resign on day 2. The meltdowns were over very silly things from normal healthy peoples standards. The mouse and mousepad at work were greasy and dirty, and I didnt notice until I touched my mouse myself and I started having uncontrollable tremors and shakes. Amongst other things, everyone and everything seems far dirtier and filthier than every before. I never feel this to this extent before. I don't even want to walk anywhere my mom has walked because she has dirty feet. Realistically she often has dirty feet but now it really really bothers me. Everything bothers me so much I feel like I cannot function in normal everyday society anymore. Not only that, but I am struggling getting and keeping a job because something always happens (likely silly) that makes me have a meltdown and I am just done with it. I will not have money coming in, I am not qualified for unemployment because I quit my last job. I also dont put I have a disability on my job applications because I know they will turn me down because of it (even though its illegal).

Like you see all these posts and tik-toks about loving yourself. However a lot of our themes are based around being “bad people”. And that sucks. Because for a neuro-typical person, it is much easier to say “oh yes I’m gonna love myself” and then try to look past insecurities and issues that they have.

But with the OCD brain, what the hell are you supposed to do when every time you say “ok I’m gonna love and accept myself” but your brain says “yeah but how could you do that if you’re faulty in such a way?”. 

And along with it comes fears of these thoughts lasting forever, wondering if your fears really are true and your brain just. Wont. Let. Go.

Loving yourself is not easy when you have OCD. Every act of self-love becomes a disciplined choice. Having to say “yes I am flawed, I am a terrible person, but I will take care of myself anyway”.

hello. i was diagnosed with ocd, adhd and depression + anxiety and was in an emotionally and physically abusive childhood... when i was 9 i started to self harm and was very suicidal, and i had ocd behaviors such as contamination and religious fears since that age. i had seeking therapy. i am 17F

however, when i was 11 and got into middle school i mixed with a certain crowd of people who were also mentally ill and they introduced me to tumblr. i went to a psychiatric hospital 3 times in middle school because of suicide, and 5 times total in my life. i recently came out two months because of attempting suicide yet i still want to die, every day i feel that i don’t deserve any of the help and that i’m an evil person 

so here’s one of my mistakes: when i was 11 i found out about DID and i thought i really did have it because i related to some of the symptoms and then for less than a week i pretended i had it. i never used it to hurt a person or as an excuse for bad behaviors, actually this was 7 years ago and i genuinely am so fucking embarrassed, i don’t know what the hell was wrong with me. i only really talked about it online once and i rediscovered it a year ago and deleted it because it was so embarrassing and odd, i feel so guilty.

however, now i feel so afraid that i’m making everything else up because of my stupidity and ignorance back then. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before that even happened, and then i was evaluated for ocd and diagnosed multiple without me even suspecting i had it. but my brain keeps telling me that ‘what if you’re lying, and maybe you really are all the bad things you fear you are and that you’re not even really mentally ill” and i get urges to quit all my meds and never go to therapy again or just kill myself.  and i wonder if i’m making everything up and that nothing is real at all and that all my issues don’t exist. 

even though i’m tormented by intrusive thoughts about wanting to hurt others or contamination or people i love getting hurt somehow.  i have these bad urges and thoughts saying that i should slice my face off. however, i feel like i don’t deserve any help, what if i’m just making this up?? even though i get extreme nagging thoughts and i can’t shake them off until i do certain things, like confessing or constantly apologizing or washing my hands, i once washed my hands in extremely hot water when i had already dry skin with eczema cuts just to shake off the gnawing feeling that i might be a pedophile. 


i’ve tried to kill myself three times and i genuinely think that the only solution to making up for my past mistakes would be dying, and i don’t even think i deserve to have resources. i cry and pray that a god exists so he can kill me and beg him to let me die because i don’t deserve being alive, i genuinely want to be dead.

once i was in the bathroom holding an eyebrow razor and i kept hearing this voice telling me i should swipe my face or else i’m a pedophile and that i should be punished for my other mistakes. 
i was dragging it across my face but then i caught myself about to swipe hard and was extremely startled.

It will be an OCD story just give it some time to get there. 

First thing I'll start with is that I think in pictures. Everything I say/read/hear gets translated into pictures (tho there's sound effects too, it's mostly images). Pictures are the native state of my mind. 

I've always been very empathetic towards objects and felt like they were people, felt bad if I treated them badly or threw them away (I blame Toy Story in part). But \~7th grade it went from the normal childhood ""my toys will be sad if I throw them"" to my toys *and other objects* giving me specific instructions, and expressing negative emotions, often threatening me, if I didn't perform that task. 

This, to my middle schooler's brain, matched the hallucinations of paranoid schizophrenia: objects talking, often being threatening, ""voices"" giving instructions... 

I went to my therapist about this and asked that we look into me potentially having schizophrenia. It's worth noting that in my childhood I had a LOT of therapists - I'm talking 10-11 therapists BEFORE this one - who were all terrible or just ineffective. I very much didn't trust this therapist, so I didn't go into details about what was happening. I just said that I've been experiencing schizophrenia-like symptoms and that I wanted to look into them. 

She didn't ask me what those symptoms were, she didn't ask why I thought it was schizophrenia. She just looked at me and said, in a plain and very tired voice, ""You don't have schizophrenia."" (Incidentally, this therapist later *kicked me out 30 minutes early and subsequently quit on me* for saying I was uncomfortable answering a very personal question she asked. I do not trust therapists. I especially do not trust child therapists.) 

Needless to say I did not get any answers. 

Growing up, taking a deep interest in psychology, taking several classes on the subject, generally looking into and reading more and more about disorders, getting involved in neurodivergent communities (esp Autism and DID), I figured out that schizophrenia does not match what I have. I was still confused and even more lost for a few more years before OCD also came into my field of view... 

So how does it all connect? 

 I do not experience auditory hallucinations, nor really visual ones. What I have is *anxiety,* not *paranoia.* Terrible, terrible anxiety, often spurned on by and surrounding these ""requests"" and ""threats"" that objects give me. Tasks are usually tapping, kissing, or putting objects in certain places facing a certain way...and the threats are recurring obsessive fears I have, often medical or bad things happening to people I love. 

Remember when I said I think in pictures? 

The ""words"" I think in my head are *visual,* I translate everything I hear *into visuals.* Intrusive thoughts, which are *VISUALS,* my brain *interprets as words!* 

What other people with OCD would understand as ""has intrusive thought -> compulsion to do specific task to specific object"" my *brain understood as* ""hears threat -> object tells me to do an action."" It's like the brain version of an optical illusion, and it's nothing like I've ever heard anyone else with OCD describe. 

Gosh, it's almost like I could've figured this out sooner and saved myself a whole lot of stress and fear and gotten help and support sooner if SOMEONE had listened to and wanted to help me when I was in middle school...",21,0

I don't check my stove, or my locks, or that my loved ones are safe. But I spend a lot of my time ""checking"" my social media presence. On several occasions I have scrolled all the way through my social media pages--I'm talking years--all the way to my first posts. Enough times that I know exactly what's there and yet I feel compelled to do it anyway. I scrutinize every photo, every caption, every status, the kind of engagement they get, etc. Sometimes I read through years worth of DMs and text messages, too, just to see how I performed. I make a lot of edits to years' old posts that nobody will see. I delete a fair amount of posts, too. Hell, I even do things like scrutinize the time it took me to reply ""STOP"" to automated messages.

*Did I get enough likes? Why didn't I get more likes? What did that person mean when they commented on my Facebook quiz result from 2009? Does that caption make me sound stupid? Why didn't my middle school best friend respond that one time I posted on her wall?* I probably have thousands of these thoughts a day. 

I pretty much gave up using social media a couple of years ago. Too many nerves about being judged. So lately I've been finding myself just repeatedly refreshing my own reddit profile. Scrolling through and clicking on every comment I've made recently. Like, for hours on end. To the point where I notice a single downvote. And this is a throwaway. I don't know any of these people and they don't know me. And yet...

Idk what I hope to accomplish by writing this. Maybe to have the absurdity of it spelled out plainly before my eyes. Maybe to see if anyone else can relate...?

Thanks for reading.

In the form of general ocd, religious ocd, ZOCD, HOCD, and now POCD. The thing is since my religious ocd I’ve had these HORRIBLE compulsions of feeling the anxious urge to search up the things I don’t want to/am most scared of. It’s like if I don’t do it I’m scared my anxiety will get worse and I feel like I just have to do it to make the anxiety temporarily go away so I feel like I have to get it over with. I don't want to but I can feel a build up of anxiety and feel that doing so would be the release for it even though I know it's not.

Examples: 

when I had religious ocd there was a specific topic I was scared of called the dark night of the soul, I feared god would do something horrible to me. Basically whenever there was any sort of search bar I got the compulsion to type that in even though I desperately did t want to see it and feared it and knew it would make my anxiety worse. 

During my POCD I had the compulsion to search up stories and experiences of pedophiles to make sure I differed from them, and within that compulsion after hearing pedophiles talk about “shota” as it’s called, I feared if I ever saw that I would turn into a prod somehow so ingot the compulsion to search up “shota” because I feared I would become attracted to children and felt I HAD to search it to make sure I wasn’t. Like to get certainty that I was disgusted, which I very much was disgusted.

When I had HOCD I had the compulsion to look up gay porn and lesbian fanfictions and stuff even though I didn’t want to

I feel like I have no control, like i have to.

This may not be what many of you want to see, but with the stuff I have seen on this sub recently about supposed cures, I feel its necessary to state that while mental illnesses can be treated, and you CAN find relief, there is no true CURE.

To say that OCD can be truly cured, as in the root cause of the disorder completely GONE, is to degrade what all of us are suffering from and dealing with.

OCD is not a bad mood, a bad outlook, something that can be fixed with positive affirmations or good vibes. This is a serious disorder. We may not like it, but all of us are in the same boat with those who have PTSD, panic disorders, Autism, Bi-Polar disorder, etc. These things cannot be cured, and saying that OCD CAN be cured diminishes what you are dealing with.

Please be careful when reading things that claim you can be cured, especially with quack pseudo science. It goes against what were fighting for.

OCD cannot be cured any more than Bi-Polar or Schizophrenia can be cured.

We can however be TREATED, and find RELIEF.

Dont give up hope friends. Relief will come.

One of my biggest compulsions is often hour long seeking of reassurance from them, going over details, trying to “solve” certain thoughts, replaying intrusive thoughts and asking whether or not they are true and what really happened, etc. 

My partner knows of this and noticed that I've had some difficulties these past days / weeks as I've been ruminating a lot (I know, this is also a compulsion) and have had a generally lower mood. I believe these heightened OCD sensations are due to the fact that I'm under a lot of work & uni stress currently but that's beside the point.

Anyhow, today my partner, who is a total godsend and super understanding, downright offered to talk things through as they know how that can make me feel better instantly and it might help to get me out of this rut and they really don't mind doing so at all. I was really tempted and I knew that I could just ask them one or two questions to reassure myself and I would in fact feel less of a burden BUT I persisted, thanked them wholeheartedly for the offer and explained that I'm still going to continue to try and sit with this myself. – For the sake of sparing them my weird thoughts / not pulling them into my compulsions and making them uncomfortable but more so, as I know that not following through with compulsions and **sitting with the uncertainty and uncomfortable feelings is the right thing to do in order to retrain the mind**. (For a moment they were actually almost pressuring me, saying that it's not nice for them either when I'm feeling down and that they really have no issue talking about these taboo topics for the 10th time but I stood my ground.)

Right now I'm sitting with the discomfort and even though the uncertainty hasn't gotten any less and I also don't see how the uncertainty about certain topics is ever going to not bother me (Seriously, this is really a bit of a fear of mine, that I'm never going to get over certain topics and they're always going to trigger me… If anyone has any tips, they'd be greatly appreciated.)

I was horribly depressed for months, ready to turn myself into the police and spend the rest of my life in a mental asylum just for having these thoughts. I visited a doctor and was diagnosed with OCD. This diagnosis helped a lot more than I knew it would! After being diagnosed I still battled my brain for 16 hours a day and was very depressed for the next few months, but it slowly started getting better. Due to all the panic attacks (at least 10 a day) and constant anxiety, I entered a DP/DR episode that lasted for about a month, and started hitting the gym and skating more and more. I stopped smoking weed completely, because it made my anxiety worse in the long run, and started recovering a lot faster. Now I barely even have those thoughts anymore, and when I do, I've learned to dismiss them. I still do have irrational obsessive thoughts, but they don't control my life like one did for a year. 

I'm still a little bit fragile. I do fear a little bit of doing that again, and I can't listen to the music I listened to going through that because it brings the memories back.

It's actually helped me develop a better relationship with my OCD and more empathy/understanding of it. I now think of my OCD as something of a defense mechanism that just wants to protect me, something like an overprotective mother (not to get too meta and off in the weeds but my own mother was rather neglectful so maybe that has something to do with it).

So as I said I've given my OCD a name. It has a feminine identity and her name is ""Bitching Betty"".

*Side note: I work in aviation and Bitching Betty is a slang term in the aviation industry for the warning system on airplanes. It's a very loud/alarming feminine voice that generally yells ""WARNING!"" into the pilot's headsets when something (often minor) is going wrong. So this name seemed very fitting for my OCD.*

&#x200B;

**Ya girl can't handle her alcohol:**

Well, I rarely drink and last night I had ONE margarita at dinner and got drunk. I then proceeded to tell my spouse about bitching betty. He knows about my OCD but I hadn't told anyone but my therapist about the personification and name.

I was immediately super embarrassed, but my spouse is such a good sport and super supportive, wasn't weirded out at all and he even made his own ""alter ego"" named ""Lazy Larry"" which was awesome and hiliarous.

On the way home, my spouse was driving (obviously), and being the standard anxious back seat driver that I am, I was like ""whoooaa, slow down that car in front of us is braking!"" Then realizing I over reacted I was like ""Sorry, that was Betty..."" and we both busted out laughing and couldn't stop the whole way home.

It reminded me of the memes from the movie Split where he's like ""That wasn't me, that was Patricia""

Anyway, this was probably more of a ""you had to be there"" story but I wanted to share something light-hearted and show that mental illness doesn't always have to be dark and heavy, there can be cute/sweet/funny moments too.",15,0

You probably are wondering why you're reading this. Same reason I came to this subreddit. I just recently joined, even though I have been reading and commenting here for ages. 

I just want you to know that you aren't alone. Rather it be OCD, POCD, OCPD, Health OCD, or what some other grouping of letters that you believe defines your life. 

I've been living with OCD for as long as I can remember. Every day seems like a struggle in some aspect or another and honestly, there were times where I wanted it to end. 

You aren't a monster because of what you fear, but rather what you chose to do with the almost unacceptable knowledge of ""I could do this"", ""I could be this"", ""this could happen"". 

I just want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that you are loved, you are important, and most importantly, you are NOT alone. Everyone struggles, and some struggles are harder than others. Please, be kind to yourself, and know that whatever ails you has only the power you give it. 

I've been medicated for years, and recently had a... ""flare up"" of symptoms and I find helping others helps me. So please, be kind, be supportive, and let people know that 
YOU ARE NOT ALONE.",137,0

It might be part of my OCD but I frequently find myself doubting that I actually have it. I keep thinking, ""You're faking it for attention. Your self-diagnosing and making a mountain out of a mole hill. You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself.""

But coming on here and hearing about other people's experiences has reassured me-- at least for the time-being-- that I really do have this disorder and I'm not alone in these feelings. I think it was when I saw posts about themes and read up on them that I just kept thinking, ""That's exactly what it feels like! I thought I was the only one!""

TV and Movies have done so much damage to our brains by portraying OCD in one way only; that's what really made me think that you only have ""real"" OCD if you have rituals that you perform the exact same way at the exact same time every day and freak out over crooked picture frames. Some of us are like that, but many of us aren't.

They don't have to be special, either. Examples I can think of include boxes and broken objects. Every time I grab it and begin to walk to the garbage, I get this rush of extreme personification and empathy for the object. I could imagine how much it would suck to be in a secure, warm home just to be randomly thrown away at any point. I tend to create a voice in my head for the objects, as well. They always ask cliche morbid questions like ""where are we going?"" and ""am I gonna get thrown away?"". Sometimes, when its really bad, I'll hear things like ""no no no no"" and ""Please don't"". Most of the time this sort of thought pops into my head, I'm unable to throw the object away out of an extreme feeling of guilt for causing it distress. The box is going back to my room with the other five. I don't even enjoy moving objects which have been in one place for a while out of concern for causing it distress from being separated from the other objects.

For example, when I moved out of my house of \~4 years at age 10, my biggest fear (which I cried over a few times) was that I would lose a small lego in the carpet or something and I would move out without it. It was incomprehensibly distressing to imagine that my negligence would cause the abandonment of a lego stud. Kind of silly, but even now, putting myself in the place of that lego is hard.

Does this sort of thinking ring true for others? I've been this way my whole life and it's just now clicked that it's unusual.",13,0

2. Treat myself like I would a friend/loved one. What do I need in this moment? Advice? Boundaries? Compassion? A cry? 

3. Be willing & bold to cope with obsessions in a healthier way. Label my compulsion & take note of what triggers it. Small steps and self compassion are HUGE. 

4. Remind myself that courage cannot be remembered, because it is never forgotten. No matter what your intrusive thoughts say, you have this amazing, radical power within you to do what YOU want. It takes practice, but our brains were designed to learn and adapt.

5. (Optional but highly recommend) Imagine warm love and energy radiating from me. Through my touch, gaze, and action, I have the power to make the world a better place.

Hi, I have GAD, DP/DR and undiagnosed but what feels like intermittent episodes of OCD throughout my life. I usually obsess over certain conditions such as schizophrenia but have also experienced what I think is HarmOCD and POCD in the past.

Recently, I’ve been convinced that I am slowly becoming some kind of violence driven maniac. I’ve been struggling quite bad with my mental health for the past 6 months due to other health problems, as a result I have spent most if not all of this time in my room. 

I apologise if this post comes across as a touch jumbled, I’m struggling to make sense of my mind at the moment. Here are my main concerns:

- ‘Fake’ feelings of pleasure from witnessing somebody else’s pain or suffering. I say fake as I don’t want to feel these feelings, but they feel genuine. Can OCD completely surpass just thoughts and jump straight to emotions? Or has my poor mental health turned me into a sadist who wishes others to feel the same pain as I do?

- Thoughts about carrying out acts of violence on other people to relieve my own mental stress and anguish.

- I started sertraline (zoloft) about a month or so ago and I’ve created this narrative in my head that the medication may be the cause of these violent thoughts and urges as I feel as though they started, or became worse when I began the medication.

- Random urges to start laughing or smiling hysterically, either completely out of the blue without a trigger or as a response of my violent thoughts or witnessing something violent in the media/online etc. I never do but the ‘urge’ is still there nonetheless.

These are my main concerns, it might be worth noting that I am not and have never been a violent person and have always found anything related to these themes wrong and upsetting. However, I am worried that these past few months of intense stress, voluntary isolation and or the medication have/has fundamentally changed me as a person and I am soon going to act out in bad ways.

1101,How to properly react to intrusive thoughts and triggers (therapist approved) in order to start healing from OCD,65,ndltt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/ndltt3/how_to_properly_react_to_intrusive_thoughts_and/,10,1621162492.0,"***This is a very important general tool, but especially if you want to start practicing ERP, this is a basic prerequisite!***

What to do when an intrusive/distressing thought or feeling show up, and you're trying not to do a compulsion or ask for reassurance but it's hard? 

You often hear the ""accept and sit with it"". 
But what does that mean, and won't it just make the fear come true and make everything worse? (Spoiler, no, it's the beginning and essence of healing with OCD, *even though it's terrifying at first*) 

""To accept and sit with it"" just means to allow the thought in your head, to accept its presence (no matter how distressing), and to not fight or suppress it, to just let it be. 
In order to not ignore/suppress it (which would only build up and fuck you over later), you also need to acknowledge it. To acknowledge means you notice it and can say something like ""oh, hey there"". 

There's specific ways you can go about responding to intrusive thoughts without engaging in compulsions, they're called ""Non-Engagement Responses"", NERs. Here they are:

1) affirmation of anxiety (yes, this makes me feel anxious, this is terrifying, this makes me panic, it upsets me, so acknowledging and wording exactly how you feel about it)

2) affirmation of uncertainty (there's no way to know, that might be true, there's no way to get 100% certainty, so acknowledging the doubt and nagging of the question and how you can't and won't get an answer, despite what the OCD claims)

3) affirmation of difficulty (that would fucking suck, that'd be terrible, it would be horrible, I would really struggle, so acknowledging how difficult it would be if the thought were true)

4) affirmation of possibility (that's possible, maybe, maybe not, it might happen, so just acknowledging that technically there's always a possibility)

all these answers don't make you engage with the content of the intrusive thought and don't give it more power, but they help you to acknowledge and disarm the OCD calmly. You can either just reply with one, or come up with a combination of them for even more power. 

So for example when you have a thought popping in like 

""your hand probably just came in contact with the door knob that a gross person touched before (contamination OCD) "", 

""you were drunk last night, the cat in your street that was run over, that was probably you (harm OCD)"", 

""you don't actually think she's hot, you prefer dick (HOCD)"", 

""you don't actually love your partner it's just attachment (ROCD)"", 

-> you allow that thought to be there, and you say ""That's possible, I don't know for sure, and there's no way to feel certain. The thought makes me feel very anxious and I'm having a groinal response which makes me panic even more, and that's okay. If this were true, it would really suck and I'd be very upset. Oh well"" and then you can sit with that discomfort for a lil bit without doing anything about it, before you just move on with your day. 

It's Important to not just make it a robotic mantra that you learn by heart and compulsively say when you have an intrusive thought, but that you individually allow it in your head, listen and then reply with whatever fits, without starting a discussion, analysing or shoving it away

I've had extreme guilt since I was a child. I remember in 3rd grade I broke down crying to confess to my mom that I had eaten on the bus in kindergarten. I was so afraid that the consequences for breaking the rules would be awful, so I didn't mention it (for three years!), but eventually I was more afraid that I would go to hell for breaking rules and then covering it up, so I confessed my sin to my mom. There was a long period of time where I would pray about what to do, pleading with god to give me wisdom, asking if I could leave it in the past because it had happened so long ago, etc.

I had some similar experiences with doing ""wrong"" things and then not being able to get over it. In many cases the guilt has been so bad I've had to confess, to at least one person, but often even after confessing I worry that I confessed it dishonestly to make myself look better, and that my actions will have a lasting negative impact on someone. I even just typed out a confession of what I believe is the worst thing I've ever done, but the fear of being told I'm a bad person is too great.

Right now I work with kids and it's a struggle any time I'm impatient, or respond shortly in a stressful situation, or have a consequence for a misbehavior that might have been a bit too harsh, or find my mind wandering when a child is speaking, or respond more slowly than others around me when a child is in need (ex: while I was with the baby on one side of the playground, the big kid got hurt on the other side and other nannies at the park noticed before I did and called me over). I worry that although I think I care, I'm really just lazy, uncaring, immature, mean, and slow. I think about how the mistakes I make will lead to self esteem issues, eating disorders, etc. in the children I watch. I read articles about how to act around children so they'll be okay when they're older, and if I can't do it just right I feel awful.",425,0

I want to start off by saying, I never intended any harm towards my ex. I know who I am and I am not capable to have full intentions of harm. This was also 2 yrs ago when I was (18) and ex was (19) I will also like to add that though these events did happen, my memory is not great from that event, so there could have been verbal consent given but I don’t recall it soo these thoughts make it worse 


So me and my ex had an overall fun relationship.He was my first boyfriend and it was exciting! So we didn’t have sex until 6 months into our relationship. which he was also my first to have sex with. Everything was great but then he moved and we had to do long distance, I didn’t mind I was in love with him. He came to visit after 5 months of being in a long distance relationship, so we had a great time! At the time I had a very high sex drive and was just ready to get in bed with him because I hadn’t seen him for months. We had sex the first night, everything was good. I think it was until the 3rd day where I asked him if we could have sex and he said “I can’t have sex, I’m not getting hard”. This is where my memory gets foggy, I don’t remember if I had asked him once or twice, and I don’t remember much of the conversation we were having but then after him saying no I do remember dropping it. But then he said, “let’s go buy condoms” we went to the store and got them. When we got home, we were making out and trying to get in the mood however it did not work (because he couldn’t get hard) I remember being upset because I really wanted to.

-Days go by we didn’t have sex between these days, I would ask but nothing and I believe it might’ve been the 5th or 6th night. We were making out and we could still not have sex. We talked about it and he said sorry that he couldn’t get hard, he wanted to but couldn’t. I also apologized! But then I remember telling him I would do anal with him (I knew he really wanted to, because he asked me a few times, so I thought that would lead to having vaginal sex) I remember him being excited & agreed. So again my memory gets foggy at this point. I don’t remember if we had vaginal sex before or after anal. I think it might’ve been after anal because he was erected while we had anal, so I remember telling him, “just f*ck me” and then we had vaginal sex-went back to anal & so on. 

-After having sex we did talk about what happened and why he couldn’t get hard. He said, “I was just having a lower sex drive.” The was the last night he was staying. So months go by and he acts the same with me, we hit one year and celebrated through FaceTime. Everything was good, then until 5 months after he went and visited me he broke up with me..he gave all of these excuses but I didn’t seem to believe him. We didn’t have contact until like a week ago(because out of my compulsion, I had to reach out to him)

-I am fairly trying to get more into politics, so with many feminists movements, I thought I would benefit from learning. So, I started reading articles about sexual assault and how consent should be given. I enjoyed learning, because I didn’t know much before. It wasn’t until I learned about the word ‘sexual coercion’ that made my ocd get bad. Before reading about this, I had no clue what it was. I’m not trying to justify my actions, but I am just saying that kids need to learn about these words. I do feel like a lot of r*pe cases could decrease simply with teaching children about consent from an early age. My ocd started spiraling, I googled similar topics, got reassurance from my family & friends if I was a good person. I started questioning if wether or not I had pressured him into having sex with me when I never took his own input. I should have asked him how he was feeling instead of being so selfish and only trying to get intimate with him. The worst thing is that I don’t have much recognition from that experience. So last week I texted him and apologized for everything. I apologized for causing any harm if had done so. He told me that I was good to him, that I did everything genuinely well but that he didn’t see us lasting for a long time. After our breakup, I didn’t get closure from him and this was in some way closure for me. We had a good talk and we talked about how our life was going, it was good to talk to him. Though this gave me reassurance that I hadn’t caused harm towards him, my ocd is still making me think “what if in the future he will think it wasn’t consensual”. These thoughts are killing me, I can’t live at peace with this past mistake. I know it was mistake because I should have not tried to get him in the mood and I should have asked him about his feelings. 

-Overall, I do believe I am a good person. Yes it took me two years to realize my actions from that event. But I do hope I can forgive myself for it. I hope that I can tell my therapist this, I’m just worried that she will call this a crime and get me sent to jail. I’m just mess right now and life is so shitty. For anyone who has experienced sexual coercion/sexual assault, I am truly sorry for what you went through. I hope life brings you happiness. 


Regardless if you call this coercion or not, I was being a selfish immature person. I wasn’t informed about sex education, wish I was from an earlier age. I have made a change though, from learning about all of this I try to inform others about consent & I’m trying to prevent others from making the same mistake. I also have been trying to get more involved with programs for victims & overall trying to get more educated on the subject. I don’t really know what I am looking for in this post, I guess just any input. I just can’t seem to move on from this mistake, what should I do? I will never make this mistake ever again! I know I won’t. I am just unsure if I deserve to move on or not....Thank you for taking the time to read this & remember CONSENT IS IMPORTANT, always talk with your partner!",19,0

I am terrified of the possibility I am a pedophile, and plagued by thoughts that I am (or will be) a pedophile. It all started with a sexual thought about a 12yo boy (I am bisexual) that escalated to thoughts that I have some sort of paraphilia.

Here's the thing: I am convinced I am only attracted to girls my age and older (though I still get some intrusive thoughts about girls under my age - I am able to dismiss them though). With boys though I am not sure. Though I am definitely primarily attracted to boys my age (14 - 16), I am scared that attractions to 12 year olds could be real. Maybe that is even normal, if they are in puberty - but what if it never goes away as I get older? I just don't know.

This puts me in a weird position. I understand that you are supposed to let the thought pass, accept it is stupid and ignore it - and that has been mostly effective I think - but what if it could be genuinely real? I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to accept it or keep telling myself it is OCD.

I have no idea how I would go about telling this to my parents, let alone a therapist or doctor. I have exams this summer, then a holiday, and I am anxious I won't be able to enjoy or focus on anything.

He has refused couples counseling, his therapist does not know about me because of his ocd (afraid of telling him), and we both believe no two people are perfect for each other; it's about learning to work with the other person's unique quirks and personality...however, I do think love cannot overcome incompatibility.

I love stereotypically romantic gestures, and I used to do them all the time for my boyfriend; love notes, sappy texts, flowers, candlelit dinners, cooking for him, buying treats whenever I went shopping, baked him a birthday cake + thoughtful gifts, massages, accommodating preferences like eating in smaller bowls, helping him clean, etc. 

My boyfriend has a lot of anxiety around romance due to being hurt in the past. For example, for christmas last year I requested he write me a love letter on any piece of paper he could find since money was tight. I never got anything and kept silent. Six months later he tells me that he used to do that for an ex and his ocd won't let him do it again because the anxiety will forever exist as long as that piece of paper does that I will betray him and show it to others and break his heart like she did. He used to buy flowers and gifts for his exes but has never bought me anything for my birthday and holidays even when I got him presents. He can't buy things because the indecision of whether or not to spend money on anything is crippling for him. I've told him a nice text or two a week or compliments would make me feel so much more loved but he can't do it.

How do we get past this? In addition to all the physical things, I often feel emotionally drained form supporting him and not receiving the same support in turn because he is mentally drained by his ocd. I'm crying as I'm typing this; I really want it to work but I feel I am turning into someone that is not myself.

Edit: We also rarely have sex, maybe once a month. I am unsure if this is related to his ocd.

Second edit: Not sure if this matters, but I am 22F and my partner is 28M. I am in college and he has graduated and is looking for a job. We've been together for almost two years.",11,0
1127,Emergency hatch protocol: what I do when I'm having a hard time with OCD,38,no9o52,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/no9o52/emergency_hatch_protocol_what_i_do_when_im_having/,11,1622375840.0,"Hey friends,

So I see this question a lot on this sub so I wanted to just put out there what I do when I'm having a hard time (normally I describe it as a 'melting brain' moment).

DISCLAIMER: This is just what I do. It might not be your thing. That's ok. This process can be stressful so please give yourself time/be safe. You know you best and this again, is just what is helpful for me. I am not a doctor. I am just someone with OCD.

Also! Please note that I'm not going to be relating this to any one kind of OCD. I use this for the different obsession topics basically without changing but of course, please feel free to augment as you like. But I always find it useful to not focus so much on what my brain has decided to worry about but instead focus on the fact that it's worrying at all.

**EMERGENCY HATCH PROTOCOL**

(because cool stuff should have cool names)

SITUATION: You have found yourself struck with anxiety or panic over something. You have OCD and you know that this feeling is coming from your OCD. 


**1. Acknowledge that this is OCD.** This can be difficult especially for people who are new to their diagnosis or to treatment. If peeps want, I can make a separate post about how I go about deciding if this is OCD or not.  



  **2. Calm your breathing.** This sounds witch doctory but you really gotta get yourself in a centered place. I imagine myself in a tunnel, one under ground. I'll be using this metaphor for the rest of the steps. Of course, feel free to imagine yourself anywhere or nowhere at all. But keep your breathing even. Your brain needs oxygen.  



 **3. Acknowledge** what your OCD is trying to do. The O in OCD stands for obsession and right now, by calming your breath, you're resisting the second part -- compulsion or at least to the best of your ability. I pretend that compulsions are like fake escape hatches in my tunnel. I've opened them before and they lead to what appears to be a way out, but the tunnels all connect. I will always end up exactly where I currently am, anxious and full of panic and still very much underground. Understand that these escape hatches look wonderful and easy and maybe feel a bit bad for yourself for not being able to use them. Escape hatch examples might be: checking that the door is locked. Asking your mom if you're a good person. Weighing yourself over and over. Resist opening these escape hatches.  



 **4. Accept. (Optional)** Accept that the worst case scenario no matter how crazy, is a fact of life and cannot be change. I'm not saying that your worries are real, just that nothing you do will fix them. And also, don't try and fix them. That means no compulsions or as little of it as you can manage. Accept that the world will end, that the food has gone bad, that the house will be robbed. Even though you know these things will not happen or are not true. This can be difficult to wrap your head around since it's a bit like playing chicken with yourself but it will get easier with practice. This step is also skipable until you feel more comfortable looking at your obsessions in this way. I know they feel very real and that this kind of acceptance can cause too much trouble than can always be handled. You know you best.  



  **5. Panic.** Ok, this sounds really scary and it is but again, this is what works for me and it's also why you gotta stay as calm as you can. The tunnel is gonna start to flood. It's gonna fill with water and you're going to panic. Because OCD sounds so reasonable sometimes. It's telling you to get out of the tunnel, to use the escape hatch and quick! But OCD controls the tunnels. It also controls the water. It's driving you where it wants you to go. You're going to panic by resisting but separate yourself as much as you can. You're gonna feel like you're drowning but the water, it isn't really there. The tunnel is dry. Allow the panic to wash over you.  



  **6. (Optional) time yourself.** I do this when I'm having a particularly difficult time. I time myself for how long I can sit focusing on my breathing. Sometimes I give myself a challenge of like, a half hour before giving in and trying for the escape hatch. Which in theory makes me feel better right because I get away from the water cool. But the tunnels are all connected and the water just comes back and now the water is coming out of the escape hatch too. So this step is for peeps who may find themselves struggling or are new to this procedure. This gives you a really good physical number to show progress or to encourage yourself even when you backslide.  



 **7. Wait.** This might be the most difficult step in this process. It's also the step that is most flexible when it comes to different kinds of obsessions. But the idea is that you wait for nothing to happen. Wait for the house not to burn down. Wait to not cheat on your spouse. Wait to not break the law. Wait to not get sick. In waiting, eventually, and this will take practice, a new escape hatch will open. Slowly. As you sit and allow the water to rise and wash over you, a new door will be uncovered. The panic will wash away the grime and this is the only way out of this tunnel. This is the door you will take. This door is not a compulsion. This door is just a door. Just a dry place. But the door is heavy and the current is strong. It will be slow. It will feel sometimes as though it may never open. It might not open today or tomorrow. You might wander through the tunnels and circle back and try again. That is ok. It's hard. It's not easy. But one day, it will open and you won't realize you've walked through it until you can no longer hear the water. It won't stay open forever. The next day you might find yourself back in this tunnel and pissed and scared because you have to do this whole thing all over again. But this time it will be just a little easier. The door won't be so heavy.   



Every time it will get a bit faster. The water might only reach your knees before you've managed to uncover the real way out. Or maybe you'll backslide and that's ok too. That's also part of the process.  


This escape hatch, it is not quick. It is not flashy. It will not fix you. But it will grant you a moment of peace, enough to dry off and comb out your hair before you're back in that tunnel again. But you have to wait for it to slowly uncover itself. You have to lift with your knees and breathe and accept where you actually are and not what OCD tells you the escape route actually is.  


I am sending you all of my strength friend.

I will sit with it and let it be, ill allow all of it in, all of it. The horror, the existentiality, the pain and misery. I let it be. And let it go. I no longer need to push it out of my mind. I no longer wish to shun it out. I accept it. Fully. 

At the end, death is no more to you than sleeping. You wont feel the ""forever"". You wont. It wont happen. People and I too have the misconception of believing that life is the default. A lack of existence was the default and always will be. But, despite how horrifying this is, if we literally cannot experience nothing then that means the very thing we have is to experience something and we are awarded a period of time to become living matter and experience ourselves. To be a part of life - to thrive, to cry, to be interested or not, to fear, to hate, to love, to have meaning. It is not within the hands of ours to view this world as some greater, larger business. It has no and not any at all impact on our lives. Remembering that the universe will die in a thousand trilion trilion trilion trilion trilion trilion trilion trilion trilion trilion years has no impact. Its the universe's business. We are not its commanders. We are not made to think of anything other than love, humanity, anger and perform all of the activities built into us because our brains werent made to think of this stuff and comprehend it, thats why its so difficult to, we werent meant to think of it beyond trying to survive, without thinking of size or existence. If we are so arrogant to think we are such overlords over life than by thinking our toughts will change the universe we are gods. Its simply so much beyond our comprehension that unless we willingly come to be interested and enjoy  learning about it then doing demage to ourselves is futile.

So what if we're some weird apes on a random planet? How will things be different if we werent? Would it change our feelings? Sure. But it will never be and dwelling is useless. Accepting, letting the feeling inward, dealing with it and being logical with insanity - is what is right. 

I live in a place where wars come and go every few years, so at some point I developed an intense existential dread - both of death and of religion. I would go on into it for months. And months. Everyday was horrible, depressing, meaningless and hopeless. For years since fifth grade Ive been plagued by this fear of death thats so ingrained in everything I do that my life quality has dropped dramatically since. It was my first pure OCD episode, and the leader to my first depressive episode. And when I became suicidal activally, I couldnt care anymore about it. In fact, I wanted it. I wanted it so bad. And eventually after that, I stopped fearing for a bit. It came and went again with the existentiallity so much that I wanted to get hospitilized but I survived and changed themes for the love of god. As bad as my themes are nothing was as bad as existential OCD. 

If I die, thats outta my hands. I can only control what I can. I can literally only control what is controllable. So why live in fear of it if it can always happen? And ruin the bit of life I have? Why? Theres no point to fearing. 

I could be killed by terrorists out in the street and tgats a real thing goibg on here. I could be mugged and shot to death. I could overdose on my pills one day on accident. But, I have no control other than taking the measures I can. So, I dont care anymore. Ive cared too much for years. Even though another war is brewing here, why should I care about it anymore? If I can enjoy what is. Not what could be. If I die its over. And I dont care anymore abiut what happens after its over. 

Im fnally trying to let go and move on. Because Im not a god and my thoughts wont ever affect anything, other than myself.",79,0
1130,Shiney Pokemon protocol: how I decide if it's OCD or reasonable worries.,189,noai0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/noai0d/shiney_pokemon_protocol_how_i_decide_if_its_ocd/,19,1622378871.0,"Hey friends,

This post is dedicated to u/No-Lemon-1183 who asked that I make this. I hope you are doing well friend!

Okay, so, again, I'm not a doctor. I'm just a person with OCD and this is what I do. It's not perfect. It takes practice. It might not work for you and that's ok. You know you best.


TW I mention cancer as an example here as well as other common example obsessions/compulsions so please keep that in mind.

**DISCLAIMER**

This is **not** a way to diagnose you. This is **not** a way to test if you have OCD. This is to be used by people who have been **diagnosed** with OCD. I'm not that smart friends. Please be cool.

Also, this will not focus on any one kind of OCD and can be retrofitted or augmented however you like to make it fit your OCD topics.

SITUATION: A thought wiggles into your brain and you start to worry about it. Maybe you wonder if you left the oven on, if you locked the door, if you want to cheat on your spouse. Any kind of thought.  

**1. What type is this?** Okay, so I'm a bit weird and I have metaphors for everything and it just so happens that for this, I use Pokemon cards to explain this to myself. It's weird. I'm also not a huge pokemon person (like they're cool but I'm kind of dumb and just admire from afar). But imagine all of your anxious thoughts are Pokemon cards. You get this new card -- does it fit into your OCD pokemon type? For example, if you know your OCD likes to focus on cleaning -- is this a worry about hand washing? Or maybe you tend to focus on your sexuality? Is this an anxious thought about someone being or not being attractive? 

Sort your cards. Keep them organized. This isn't always going to work though so keep that in mind. Like -- ocd is weird and one day all your OCD thoughts are grass types and tomorrow they're fire types and that's just the way it goes. But giving them categories can be helpful.

**2. Wait to see if it evolves**. Ocd is always trying to evolve its pokemon. Most thoughts are perfectly ok with just being regular levels of worry. Not OCD. It gets more powerful over time as it tries to prod you into a compulsion. Of course, this would require you to resist your compulsion for a time to allow the obsession to build which can be difficult. So don't beat yourself up if you can't do this step right away. But any pokemon that evolves, especially if it evolves quickly and only when you're trying not to pay attention to it, that's a good sign it's OCD.

**3. Is it shiny** ok...so this is gonna sound strange but please stick it out with me. Imma try my best to explain this. For me, meds helped a lot with this and like, meds work really well for me and I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea but just know that I found meds to help me with this step.

But asking if this pokemon is shiny means -- is it too pretty? Is it too neatly packaged and well thought out? I'm talking, Hollywood makeup levels of unbelievably bad worries. Example shiny Pokemon are: even though you're a very good student, you worry you've forgotten an assignment. Even though you've asked your doctor you're worried you're sick. Even though you live in an area with low crime you worry that your house will be broken into.

The example shiny Pokemon are all technically possible, these Pokemon are going out of their way to show off with just how terrible they could be. I have a friend who was worried she had cancer and did this process with me over the phone. We sorted the thought and waited and tried to decide if someone so young could have cancer but here's the last step that's so important -- she was in a lot of physical pain. And guess what that card isn't shiny now is it.

**Physical reactions** are totally possible with OCD but we're talking horrible horrible pain. So yup, nah fam, this card is a regular old Pokemon card. And she went to the doctor and she had cancer and it was early and she got better.

I AM NOT HERE TO WORRY FRIENDS OKAY

This takes a lot of practice. And you're going to get it wrong sometimes. Sometimes you'll be convinced this is OCD and you'll wake up and actually you did forget the assignment or you did get your house broken into.

But using these steps as **tools** can help you get more comfortable in resisting compulsions more often, which is always the goal. Don't go trying to catch Pokemon that aren't even there. We got a limited amount of pokeballs.

1132,OCD Ruined My Ability To Create Art,56,noda3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/noda3h/ocd_ruined_my_ability_to_create_art/,16,1622387765.0,"So... I'm on artist who mostly does art as a hobby. Drawing and, to a lesser extent, writing, has been my passion since I was very small. Creating things had been my go-to comfort activity and it's what mostly kept me sane and able to wake up everyday looking forward to something fun. It was my outlet for a lot of things.

But that all changed within the past 3-4 years.

A little background on me: I was diagnosed with OCD when I was in my mid-teens and, back then, my obsession was contamination and germophobia. I still have a touch of these things, but usually after I get over one obsession, a new one pops up (as many of you already know). About 4 years ago, I had a massive breakdown due to severe depression and anxiety and I've never been the same since. It was shortly after this event that my obsessions decided to shift again, this time...

To art.

I've been searching the net to see if anyone has my specific problem related to my... Art OCD I guess? But the closest thing I could find was ""maladaptive perfectionism"". When I make art as of late, I'm constantly being over critical of myself and I have to keep making changes or fixing things because they're not ""perfect"" in my eyes. Especially with drawing; I'll obsess over one line for far too long using CTRL+Z, and even after I get it ""right""... I might just come back and change it again. With writing, I keep obsessing over plot holes and possible mistakes. Both of these make it so frustrating that I have to step away from my computer feeling defeated and angry at myself.

It's been a few months since I've done any art, and in that time, I've deluded myself into thinking I can't draw or write anymore. My self-esteem has hit an all-time low and I don't know why. Close friends and others tell me they love my art. I feel guilty for going MIA sometimes.

So here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to try to draw or write something at least 3 times a week. Even if it's just scribbles or creative ramblings, I'm going to do it. I'm not in therapy right now because my therapist left (and I liked her a lot :( ), but I'm following her advice to just keep trying and exposing myself to creativity again.

Has anyone experienced something similar? If so, how did you handle it?

Thanks for reading.

Side Note: I'm on an anonymous account, so I won't be linking any art stuff here or showing it off (I think it's against the rules anyways). Sorry.

So I started a project where I collect and publish people's ‘Letters to their mental illness’ where anybody can post letters to their illness, from eating disorders, bipolar, agoraphobia, depression, OCD etc. Alternatively you could write to a loved one about the illness. It’s all anonymous of course. The aim is to share the letters and read other people's letters and hopefully it will make us feel less alone!

You can pick up NAC at Walgreens, you can learn how to do ERP online or with your therapist.

Please give this combination a try if you have given up hope...

I have suffered with Schiz-OCD 24/7 for the past 7 months and this is the first time I have truly felt somewhat like my old self again. For months I was absolutely hopeless, living in constant (and I mean constant) fear for literally weeks on end.

NAC is an amino acid that works directly with the brains glutamate system to balance out any spikes that occur. Imbalanced glutamate is one of the main reasons for many mental disorders, especially ones that are structured around anxiety. It is primarily used for people struggling with skin picking (which is essentially a compulsion in response to anxiety)... However, the same mechanism works extraordinarily well for OCD.

ERP is essentially not doing anything to combat the thoughts as they come in, nothing at all. This can also be described as acceptance as you literally don't respond to the content of the thoughts in any way. This gets your brain used to the idea that the disturbing thought you had is nothing to worry about. However, doing ERP every waking moment can bring a lot of stress on the body and mind (as it's supposed to if done right). For me, NAC has mended those feelings of constant tension and has made it easier to simply let the thoughts go unanswered.

If you have access to this supplement, please do yourself a favor and give it a shot! ERP is important to combat the thoughts themselves but as far as the chronic feeling of stress associated with OCD, NAC (n-acetylcysteine) has had a very noticeable affect on diminishing those symptoms.

Please give it a shot or at least talk about it with your doctor!

I take 600 mg, twice a day. One in the morning and one mid-day. 1200mg total.

Please, for the love of God, try this supplement or at least discuss it with your doctor. I am begging you, especially if you have given up hope.

If I was a billionaire I would send each and every one of you a year's supply of it with no hesitation.

Have I mentioned please fucking try it yet.

Ranging from fear of vomiting as a kid to fearing HIV for months on end. Fast forward to the two month lockdown in Ontario and it took a whole new turn. I wrote an essay for a sociology class in April and hyperfixated on the word ""Oedipus Complex"". I then made the mistake of asking myself if it means I agree with Freud (despite being a full fledged homosexual) and it lead to incest OCD. For a month I completely dissociated from reality as I could only focus on this voice telling me ""you want to fuck your mom"". When I finally had a doctors appointment, he suggested I have OCD and everything changed. I studied the fuck out of it, and throughout the process developed other themes like POCD. Here is how I managed to get a grip

1. Everyone has intrusive thoughts, you can't control them, just your reaction
2. ERP (Exposure Response Therapy) is the only way out. Chase the thoughts. Visualize them. Let your anxiety spike as high as possible and eventually you will become desensitized. This can take time. Be patient.
3. You have to WANT to get better. Attitude and mindset is everything. It feeds of of fear and doubt. It's like a cancer, the more you feed it what it wants, the more it grows. 
4. Don't do your compulsion. Don't argue with the thought. Sarcastically agreeing with it sends the message that it was pointless. 
5. Don't dread the thoughts. Don't be scared of them. Welcome them. Consciously think about them and let it exist. Reminder: they can't hurt you - they aren't even real.
6. Self pity gets you no where. I realized this over time and can say that the more we wonder, ""why is this happening to me?"" or ""I just want to be normal"" it sends your brain the idea that you're scared of your OCD thoughts. You cannot feel sorry for yourself. You cannot fear anything. The more you fear the thoughts or wonder ""when will this end?"" - IT WONT. You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself and asking what you did to deserve this. 
7. Be your own best friend. Would you talk to yourself the same way you would your best friend? No. Be kind to yourself. Unconditional acceptance is so important.
8. Remind yourself that OCD is an anxiety disorder and not a terminal illness. It shows you're an empath. Good job :)
9. Don't seek reassurance. Ever. Deep down you know who you are. 
10. Consider CBT and medication if it becomes unbearable. I haven't done much CBT but have been prescribed 20mg of Citalopram and would recommend it.

There are many resources out there for people who can't access or afford therapy. Learning about mindfulness and the benefits of meditation have also really helped me. I'm going to link some Youtube videos that got me out of my rut and brought me back to reality. Some people I found very helpful are Katie d'Ath and Mark Freeman.

I've always had OCD symptoms since childhood but never really thought they were problematic. They were basically simple compulsive tasks like trying not to step on the red part of the curb and other negligible actions until one night[late 2018] I started having these violent/gory images of people I hold dearly getting killed or tortured in gruesome ways. These aren't just thoughts or still images, they're like a nightmare, the only difference is that I can't wake up or shake them off...for example when I'm in class or with friends/family all external stimuli halts and my mind just focuses on whatever unwanted thoughts I'm having at the moment. 

They came outta nowhere. I haven't even watched a horror movie or played a gory game[although I used to watch/play those alot] that day. I thought they would stop by the time I fall asleep but they didn't. The next day they developed into sexual thoughts which were much worse than the violent stuff. I started having scenerios in my mind where I'm raping my 12 yo sister and having sex with my mother. You wouldn't imagine a fraction of the absolute misery I've felt every time I had those and this was the point where I started to think about killing myself, right from the next day. I spent hours upon hours googling for quick painless suicide methods and it frustrated me every time Google showed ""suicide prevention"" instead of what I typed. 

This torment would go on for a couple of weeks until it slowly dwindles to a level where I can no longer live in a constant distress but I would still require distraction like a phone or computer otherwise they come back. I dunno how and I can't explain it. It just stopped being that extreme. 

Fast forward 6 months of relative peace of mind and active social life the thoughts kicked off again conveniently when I was playing Resident Evil 4. I'll try to word how I felt, at the beginning I would have this dreadful feeling of realization in my stomach, I was ""oh shit! this can't be happening again"" I couldn't believe I'm about to go through all that mental torment again then once the thoughts begin they will never go. This time they redoubled in intensity to the point where I am feeling literal physical pain in my body. For example if I see my fingers getting crushed by a hammer then I'd feel the pain like I'm experiencing it. It kept getting worse, from worrying about how to get rid of the unwanted thoughts to how to deal with the pain. Other imagery I would have is my limbs getting sawed off, my balls getting crushed or slashed. These are the worst so far. This time they lasted for about two months and just like the previous time, the intensity decreased very slowly until they became in the background then completely forgot about them. 

Now they are back for the third fucking time. Few hours ago I had a flashback of how I was struggling through the intrusive thoughts and somehow they stuck and now I can't let go. I can't stop them, I can't concentrate on my studies/exams, I can't listen to my mom or sister, I can't even see their faces because I'm busy seeing them getting raped or ran over by a semi-truck. 

Before you tell me to welcome my thoughts in the hopes that I become desensitized, I tried and it didn't work. All of my attempts to stop them were fruitless including ERP which(with all due respect) I find to be absolute bullshit. I would spend two hours visualizing the thoughts without any results.

I'm posting this because I'm desperate and tired. I live in a third world country where mental health issues aren't taken seriously and the quality of psychiatry is pretty damn low. They just put us on medication until we collapse or simply laugh at us and tell us ""go out more"" and ""it's just a phase""(unironically). Even my mom my best friend told me to go back to God and start praying again. This is the worst situation that anyone can live. I really don't want to live like this for the rest of my life and I'm certainly not going to have another episode of this shit. I'll off myself before I go through it again.

I walk around this fucking house with my hands clasped together “👏🏽” looking like a fucking monk because I can’t touch fucking doorknobs or light switches. I wouldn’t be surprised if I forgot how to walk normally.

Days ago, i saw a man for a second and after 15 seconds, I could not  see him. There are some ways and buildings he may have gone to but to me  it seemed as if he was standing.

I was worrying that he may have vanished and that it may have been a  glitch in the simulation system (if we are in a virtual world).

After 5-15 minutes, I took photos of  the place in order to show the  place to 2 friends and together find possible ways or buildings that the  man may have gone to. I WANTED so much to find an other explanation in  order to calm down.

i worry about an hypothetical punishment for taking photos of the  place. what if Gods thought that I was trying to capture evidence, even  though I was not? There was not any glitch in the photos and i was not  trying to capture any.

Some concidences started happening that I worry that they may be bad signs from Gods about the photos.

For example:

I was in bed with my eyes closed and while losing control of my  thoughts, I ended up thinking ""oh go to devil"" (greek expression),  Almost a second later, my brother may have said the same expression  while playing an online game. I did not hear his words clearly but the  melody sounded like that expression. Its a phrase we never say. How I  ended up having that thought? and i cant remember what i was thinking  before thinking that phrase.

for many days, I was worrying that this may have been a bad sign from  Gods because of the photos. I replayed/analyzed the  coincidence/expression many times. One time, while I was analyzing it. I  thought that phrase again and on the same time, I heard a woman from  outside, saying something that sounded like the word ""devil"". 

I did not hear her words clearly but the sound of it, sounded like  something that the last syllabe was the same or almost the same as the  syllabe from the word ""devil"" (in my language). If she really said that  word, then it came as a perfect synchronicity with my thought.

What are the chances of these 2 synchronicities happening? 

I am a mentally ill man who spend 4 years worrying about  scrupULolisity related things and now, I was so unlucky that I found  myself in a place in which a glitch may have happened? Am I so unlucky  that Gods decided to punish me for the photos,even though I was not  trying to expose anything? Are They sending me signs to tell me that I  got punished?

Is this all my fault? Is it my fault that I started worrying about  that man? is it my fault that I foolishly thought that by taking photos  of the place I will calm down b",10,0

1195,Am I a pedophile or is this pocd?,11,odatly,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/odatly/am_i_a_pedophile_or_is_this_pocd/,4,1625362996.0,"So for a little bit of background information, I'm 16 years old. I have been diagnosed with OCD, yet I'm still here wondering if this is ocd or not. This might be triggering for some so read with caution.

I have had small amounts of pocd in the past (intrusive thoughts, groinal response, etc.) But I never actually worried I was a pedophile because I just told myself that ""I'm definitely not a pedo, that's disgusting."" It didn't bother me as much as any other ocd obsession. This all changed recently though. It all started when I went to a kids dance recital. I knew I would have some ocd, but didn't expect it to be so bad. I was having intrusive thoughts the entire time since these girls were in dresses, dancing to songs with sexual lyrics. I ended up having an anxiety attack over all of this, fearing that I was a pedophile. This started the pocd obsession.

Recently I signed up to earn a college scholarship, which required that I tutor children for a certain number of hours. I chose to tutor Kindergarteners because I love younger kids and I thought that would be easier. I also knew it would be good exposure for my OCD. 

I walk into the class, and see this girl that immediately reminded me of a (teenage) girl I had/have feelings for. Let's call the child ""Michelle"" and lets call the teenage girl ""Jessica.""  I have strong feelings for Jessica for reasons I will not share, however I do think its important. Anyways, I see this kid that reminds me of Jessica and I'm like ""oh no."" I knew it was gonna cause me a lot of OCD. 



Basically everything up to here was typical ocd symptoms. But then there is this kid who reminds me of someone I have feelings for. I automatically knew it would be an issue. This is the part where its different. In most pocd posts, I see people saying ""I've never been attracted to a child in my life."" But my situation is different. I was attracted to this kid who reminds me of Jessica. I gained this disgusting infatuation with her because of it. I was actually attracted to this child 🤮🤮 Because of OCD, I avoided her most of the time. But when I did talk to her, i got butterflies. I saw this child in a sexual way at times like if she was wearing a short dress or lifted her shirt up, as little kids do. The entire time I just told myself that the only reason I was looking at Michelle this way is because of my infatuation with her, caused by the fact that she reminds me of Jessica. This is probably true because none of the other kids in the class caused me as much distress as Michelle did.

All of this sounds like things a gd pedophile would say. So I'm making a post to ask people what they think. Because my ocd has almost convinced me that I'm truly just a pedophile. And that scares me. I would kill myself if I am. Am I a pedo or am I only attracted to this girl because of the whole Jessica thing???? I dont think a real pedophile would obsess and feel the guilt that I do. But the fact that I ever saw a kid in this way is so convincing that I really am just a pedo. I have every single OCD symptom and I was diagnosed with it. But the only thing different from other pocd posts is when people say ""I've never been attracted to a child."" I feel extreme guilt over this entire situation.",11,0

Every single time I find something I like, compulsions start happening and ruining my life. For example, when I started taking music lessons and enjoying myself, I’m doing this compulsion where I have to sing in this specific way to make sure my voice isn’t damaged. At the beginning, when I was 6, it was just small things like having to take a certain amount of steps to my room or I won’t like my snack. But then in my summer leading up to 5th grade I went to a two week sleepaway camp where there was this one rare plant that was poisonous. That triggered a lot of bad stuff that has happened in these last 3 years. At first I didn’t eat food plain and simple, and had to have sugar through shots or something like that. I was close to dying and it was scary for my whole family. Eventually, after about a year of struggling, I made a breakthrough and finally could eat food without watching my parents or making sure it wasn’t poisoned. Then, right when I started to be happy, more compulsions kicked in. Now before I ever eat food, I have to ask my parents if it is poison and then ask them to swear on their lives. On top of all this random everyday compulsions hinder my ability to do anything with my friends. I have to repeat myself because I’m worried if I don’t, then people will think that I said something else, then kill me (I know it is stupid). I like to think of myself as smart and logical, but the OCD just like controls me. For half of my life, I have been trying to resist. I’ve gone on medicine, seen many therapists, and I work impossible hard to get these compulsions to stop. I am not joking when I say I get at least 5000 compulsions a day. It’s almost every 30 seconds and it’s been ruining my life. I know I am very lucky to grow up in a good happy home and that I shouldn’t be complaining, but this OCD has put me in a deep deep pit of depression.",10,0

Cross reference whatever you’re worried about with someone who doesn’t struggle with OCD.

It made me feel silly and dumb, but in the best way.

To keep it short, I've read a lot of philosophical texts over the past three years, studying intensively.  It's led me to question basic things about reality, obsessively.  A common example is where I'll be watching a movie, or doing literally anything, and if a character gains an advantage or considers something 'good' or 'bad' I'll question the reality of those concepts.  For example, asking how we know whether good and bad are real things; and if not, why should we tie our lives and our ambitions to intangible mental concepts? Then I obsess about how there is a non-material dimension of existence - our evaluation of the material world - which seems to have priority, and think about what this means.

My name is Dr. Sam Greenblatt. I am a psychologist who specializes in OCD treatment and I wanted to share a version of an article I wrote a little while back as I think it could help some folks on this subreddit.

I've never seen this question asked on OCD community forums, but I think is essential for a reader with OCD: **“Why are you reading this?**”

So many times with OCD we can fall into traps of *overutilizing* online resources. In the OCD world, **an action alone is not necessarily skillful nor compulsive; it is the intent behind the action that determines whether or not it is healthy and useful**. If you determine that reading through forums is likely going to provide you new and useful information, it is likely a skillful action. If, however, this is the umpteenth time that you have been combing through blogs, Reddit threads, Facebook groups, and publications, it is worth considering whether you are compulsively trying to answer an OCD question in your mind.

One way to help decide if you are compulsively searching for information is to ask yourself **if you’re past the point of diminishing returns**. Are you no longer getting a good return on investment from the information you’re consuming? Do you find yourself reading similar information over and over? Are you no longer frequently learning new and useful information that is likely to lead you to treat your OCD? The answer to those questions will help determine whether it's useful to continue digesting online resources or whether it's time to take a different next step like therapy.",57,0

I think that off all my rituals and compulsions, the obsessive thoughts are the worst because I can never stop them.

I have had OCD for 3 years now, all through high school. I would classify my OCD as pure ocd because it’s always an irrational thought that explodes into something way more worrying, which leads to compulsions such as avoiding, intense rumination for long periods of time typically overtaking my main life priorities, and looking for reasons to back up my beliefs.


OVERCOMING OCD: MY TRIPLE LAYERED STRATEGY

1. Don’t do startup compulsions: Don’t google things, don’t try to make meaning of meaningless thoughts, don’t avoid anything. Understand that people without OCD will have a worrisome thought such as “What if I get robbed tonight,” and instead of going to hide all of their possessions, they ‘accept the uncertainty’ (key words for beating ocd) but with low probability for negative results. They simply allow the thought to come and go, and take a small chance that they may get robbed.

2. Expose yourself to the thing: it will just provoke anxiety at first, there will be no realization. After a while, the anxiety will decrease. Just trust the process, it’s all you have. This is ERP to my knowledge, for example if I am afraid to touch a pan because it MAY have the germs to kill me, I will still touch the pan any time I need to and accept all of the anxiety it provokes. If you do more noticeable physical compulsions like hand washing, stop the hand washing and accept the anxiety. This anxiety will decrease hugely in time. The reason ERP took me so long to grasp is because I would always p*ssy out way too early and expect some change but no. Don’t stop doing the exposures when they come to you in life.

3. Last step is pretty simple, but not easy. Don’t slow down in life: Keep doing things you been doing, if you stop them then this is avoiding things which makes you weaker and leads you into an overthinking cycle.

Conclusion: 
I have been to a couple of therapies that didn’t completely accurately do their job. But as far as I have looked, nobody has an easy guide on beating OCD anywhere online. So if my steps don’t work for you, know that it’s because a 16 year old came up with them with 0 teaching only self-research. But they work for me, and I will be seeing an OCD specialist soon to back this up. If you are struggling with OCD and lost like I was then try my stuff. 

Any questions can go to my DMs on Instagram, @mjlaroche13 or in the comments I will try to respond

I’m trying to help as much as I can because this disorder is so very painful. But we will get better.

I don’t know how to explain how incredibly painful OCD is. How debilitating it is. How consuming it is. It’s like our brains were wired with the purpose of torturing us. OCD takes the things you care about, love, and value, and absolutely destroys them, leaving the sufferer unable to enjoy anything because it has become consumed by OCD.  

OCD is an endless painful torturous cycle. You can’t stop thinking about the things that you don’t want to think about. No matter what you do, no matter how much reassurance you get, it doesn’t stop. The thoughts themselves are literally painful. I don’t know how else to describe them. They are like knives stabbing me in the brain. I dread being awake because every second that I am awake I am consumed by disturbing thoughts and forced to do ridiculous repetitive actions that don’t make sense and make me look stupid. OCD attacks your character and your morals. It makes you feel like you are a horrible person. It convinces you that you have just tricked everyone into thinking that it’s OCD including yourself and that you are actually just in denial and the terrible things that you think are actually true. It makes you feel so horrible about yourself that you think you shouldn’t exist. It makes it so hard to function in the real world. Every action, every movement becomes consumed by OCD. Every second of every day becomes consumed by OCD. It destroys lives. It destroys hope. It is a monster that devours your values, hopes and dreams, until you are a shell of yourself. It is absolute torture. Literally torture. I used to bang my head against the wall to try to get it to stop.  

A lot of meds don’t work, treatment is so incredibly difficult (but effective!). I just don’t understand how people go around saying they are “so OCD” when literally we are over here being tortured every second of every day. I can’t even begin to describe how much OCD has wreaked havoc on my life. It’s so horrible. And literally no one understands how incredibly painful it is.",232,0

I went into therapy thinking i had ocd after experiencing harm ocd and not knowing what it was called (a hellish year of that by the way)  and after doing months of research i saw that all of my other themes were common ( a revelation).

My therapist told me that I had ocd tendencies but not OCD itself, and then I was diagnosed with GAD and Depression. I was confused because I had never heard of someone having harm ocd intrusive thoughts and compulsions as having GAD. (Mines were also quite severe)

As I did more and more sessions I started to kind of see this undertone my therapist was giving out when I would talk about my intrusive thoughts. As if she didnt believe me or something. Most times she would get kind of confused when I would talk about my intrusive thoughts so I just stopped talking about it as much since she didnt believe me. However I *still mentioned atleast once in every session how bad my intrusive thoughts + compulsions were*. 

On one of my last sessions I asked her how come I didn't have OCD and how it was just GAD. I was kinda fed up of not addressing my ocd related issues in therapy and I just wanted to know how the hell I didnt have OCD. 

We went through all of the criteria in dsm 5 of ocd and I met every single one of them but she wouldnt diagnose me because ""I didnt understand how bad it was"" she literally told me: 

\*scoffs, ""you cant have ocd, ocd is a nightmare you literally cant do anything if you have it""\*

Especially most of us, when we're home alone, sometimes exchange a few words with ourselves in engaging internal dialogue. And become our own therapists, 

which, as we all know, can be very effective. 

On the other hand, is talking to yourself a sign of intelligence or loneliness? & what's the psychology behind it?

I’ve always wondered this because I think it may a big misconception about OCD. I was told when I was 18 that I had ocd by my therapist at the time. It started with relationship ocd when I had a CRIPPLING fear of losing feelings for my- at the time boyfriend. Now, me being 21, I still struggle but on a much more complex level. 

I started developing a fear of being a narcissist to the point where I still believe deep down that I am. To the point where me typing this now feels like I’m just faking all of this and I’m lying to myself. I know this is common with people with ocd but I haven’t seen a therapist in years and I’m afraid that I was misdiagnosed and I don’t have ocd. (Which I’m also pretty sure is just another thing my brain wants to latch on to) 

But, I always see people discussing pureO or ocd in “what if’s” all the time. My thoughts are most definitely not what it’s. I know a lot of peoples intrusive thoughts start with that but I think it’s worth bringing awareness to those of us who deal with more ruminating anxiety fueling thoughts. My thoughts usually just FEEL as though they come from a place of “deep knowing” that I’m just choosing to avoid. For example, I’ll have thoughts that “I know I don’t have ocd why don’t I just admit it and stop doing mental gymnastics” but for some dumb reason I’ll have a contradicting thought that says, “but I do think this IS ocd. Obviously. You’re going back and forth.” And then it spirals from there. Sometimes the anxiety is even tolerable but it’s just that mental loop thought process. Can anyone relate? 

I always hear people talk about ocd like, “I can’t get these thoughts to stop and they’re so debilitating and unwanted” but I think maybe it gets to a point where you can’t recognize that the thought is unwanted. It almost feels like a part of your identity? Most times I can’t confidently say, “this is a very unwanted thought outside of myself” it just feels like my natural brain which makes me question my ocd diagnosis. 
This whole thing has made me question my diagnosis so much. I think a lot of people with OCD get so used to these thinking patterns that it feels normal and the anxiety is almost comfortable. I’m always wondering rather or not this is ocd and then I tell myself to stop pretending like I care and jut admit that I’m doing this all for attention. It’s weird. 

Anyways, a lot of ocd thoughts are not what if’s for me. I’m sure some can relate.",135,0

My main concern is my night time ritual and all the habits surrounding getting to sleep but that’s not what this post is about.

I never considered the way my brain obsessively goes over situations I’ve had in the past, mostly social situations that have damaged my self esteem in some way, to actually be a form of instructive thoughts or rumination, but it makes complete sense. 

I think it’s become progressively worse since a breakup I experienced just before the pandemic. I play over every single detail obsessively, and if I can’t get to the route of the problem, I will grow agitated and anxious, and then I find myself replacing that thought with a different one. They aren’t all related to him and the relationship, although I think they stemmed from him (he was emotionally abusive, and that combined with someone with strong OCD tendencies/anxiety is a recipe for hell).

But even if they aren’t about the relationship/breakup, I will have some other form of social interaction I’ve had and replay it continuously until another equally as damaging thought replaces it, and it doesn’t stop. It’s stopping me from living and it’s damaging my self esteem, because all the thoughts are based on how people perceive me, whether I am attractive enough, if I am perceived as weird, if anybody actually likes me. I also suffer from body dysmorphia and disordered eating, which I know is quite common in the OCD community.

I’m trying to find a suitable therapist, and I am looking online for tips, attempting meditation and mindfulness etc.

Today my brother was going through my book notes for school, and noticed that I had only used one coloured sticky note for the entire book. He then commented that that’s where, “my OCD really comes in clutch.” 

I just blew up after that. I went on a 5 minute rant explaining that that’s not what OCD is and it’s not someone being merely organized; it’s so, so much more than that. I kept telling him “only if you knew” and proceeded to explain how many people with OCD cannot eat properly, they cannot be in social settings, and they cannot do things without being tortured by debilitating thoughts. And that’s not even all of it, I said to him, in which he even replied “that’s stupid if you think like that” to one of my personal obsessions I shared with him. Thankfully he was quiet after but I always get this sense of guilt after I explain my hardship with this disorder because it’s so fucking exhausting and it’s been like this for years.

I always try to keep cool with my family but ever since being diagnosed with multiple disorders it’s like none of them had made an actual effort to do research or understand to a certain level.

Besides, anhedonia could be categorized in two aspects, anticipatory anhedonia and consummatory anhedonia. Anticipatory anhedonia means an inability to predict the future experience of pleasure as well as lower motivation to take action toward achieving pleasure. Consummatory anhedonia means you couldn’t feel momentary pleasure that is experienced while engaged in an enjoyable activity.

Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with OCD last year and am on meds, in therapy. I've been actively working so hard on doing everything I can mentally to relieve my OCD and depression. I really would like to tackle
my physical health. What I've eaten/how much I've worked out kind of took the backburner this last year bc I was just focusing on being able to function and go to work. Now that I'm doing better, I want to push myself in a healthy way. 

Along with OCD and the pandemic, I put on some weight last year. More than I'm comfortable with and I feel not so great. I'd really like to work on not binge-eating and being more mindful of my caloric intake, but every time I try a weight loss app or counting calories it turns into a terrible obsession, where I'm driving myself insane trying to be perfect calorically and eating ""perfectly"" (thanks, OCD).

Does anyone here also struggle with this? Or have any advice for how to handle this particular obsession? It's like I get this all or nothing mindset.",13,0

Although I found that analogy useful, it didn't address where my intrusive thoughts came from, or why I was getting those 'e-mails' on those particular subjects so often.

Now that I have overcome my OCD, I realize that I had not only been reading and believing the spam that I received, but I had been responding to them too, actively engaging with the sender on the subjects. And as everybody knows, that's about the worst thing you can do.

It must be something else, lets start searching again!' and then it starts scanning again, not by my will, but just kind of automatically...

1317,How to get better.,10,pieoxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/pieoxl/how_to_get_better/,36,1630854242.0,"I’m posting this because someone clearly needs to say it again. I have beat ocd after an 18 year long struggle without diagnosis. After getting diagnosed earlier this year it was bittersweet. It was great to know what was going on in my head but not great to hear I had an anxiety disorder. 

Anyway….IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER, here is my advice. Ask me anything in the comment section if you would like. 

(1)Leave this sub immediately-If you’re serious about getting better, you need to surround yourself with likeminded individuals that actually want to get better. I’m not judging anyone here because I’m clearly at a different stage in my ocd recovery, but if you’re serious about getting better you really need to leave this sub. There is a lot of enabling and reassurance seeking here and if you can’t see that, maybe recovery just isn’t for you. 

(2) Figure out what you love and make that a priority- Even if it seems small do it. Puzzles, movies, tv, video games, book, etc. but make sure it’s actually worth it. Keep in mind that playing video games and watching movies/tv isn’t a productive way to spend your time and do your best to limit this. Playing video games is super fun and especially when you complete achievements and stuff, but none of that success follows you into the real world so do your best not to get sucked into it. Same with movies and TV. 

(3)exercise 

(4)Make sure you involve your loved ones in treatment- If you want to get better, reassurance seeking needs to stop. And the only way to make that happen is to involve people closest to you in your treatment plan. 

(5)Be Careful who you tell you have ocd to-Only tell people that are close to you and you know won’t cast judgement on you. Mental illness STILL has a strong stigma, so if you want to live a happy life be careful who you tell this to. It could potentially cost you jobs and friendships. It’s a blessing IMO because I don’t like surrounding myself with people like that but still…be mindful of this. 

(6) Go to Therapy and tell them EVERYTHING- If you’re going to therapy and just going through the motions, don’t expect to get better. Tell them everything. 

(7) ERP ERP ERP ER- NOCD has an app for self guided erp so use it

(8) consider medication

(9) find the right doctors for you

(10) Trust your doctors, but always remember that you know yourself better than anyone else. I’ve been misdiagnosed multiple times. Why? Doctors tend to think they know everything.",10,0

Like someone that is able to hear the mailman put mail in his mailbox from inside his closed house, and if a book falls from a shelf it sounds incredibly loud. People with ocd are that but emotionally. It is why people on this subreddit are some of the least judgemental, and most understanding people I have encountered. Compared with other subreddits, the people on here actually consider who they are talking to rather than just reacting to others like as if they are flies next to your face. I think ocd despite all the bullshit it gives us, makes us humbler and more understanding or willing to understand others because we understand what it is like to be misunderstood.",350,0

1332,Things I have learned from having OCD pretty much my whole life.,47,pmxjpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/pmxjpe/things_i_have_learned_from_having_ocd_pretty_much/,5,1631469271.0,"1. You have to learn how to have ultimate self love and acceptance. No matter what you've done or what you fear you'll do, you have to live with yourself and if you cannot learn to love and accept yourself, faults and mistakes and all, you will never have peace. Accept yourself 100%. 
 2. Life is very grey. And so are humans. OCD screams about how life is two extremes; either black or white. But that isn't true. It is grey for so many things. 
3. Nothing in life is ever certain. The only thing in life that is certain is death, that is it. Nothing else is. This is hard to accept because ocd wants and needs certainty. But once you realize it is not possible in this world, only then can you try to work towards peace. 
4. You can better yourself everyday and live a beautiful life. 5. You don't need all the answers. Not knowing is sometimes the best thing you can do. 
6. Thoughts mean nothing. 
7. Everyone makes mistakes, sometimes small, sometimes huge ones. No matter what, you can always try to better yourself and destroy the ""old"" you. Don't listen to cancel culture, it is a toxic belief and is extremely triggering to those with OCD. 
 8. Memories are a weird thing.. Even for people without OCD they can easily be all over the place. With OCD you can have vivid memories of things that didn't even happen. The goal is to learn to accept you can never know certainty and you have to accept the maybe. Chances of it being true are next to zero, but you have to accept that small ""maybe it did happen!"" 
 9. Not everyone will understand what you go through. Nobody but those who have OCD know just how extremely horrible this illness is. So badly so that pretty much not a one of us would wish this on their worst enemy, it is that bad. Nobody deserves it. Not a soul.
10. Accepting there is no cure is hard, but realizing recovery is possible and can help a ton makes all the difference. There is hope and it won't be this bad forever. 
 11. No matter your theme, it is still ocd. It may even try to convince you that what you have is not even OCD, that is simply yet another one of its gaslighting tricks. 
 12. Your brain is not like others, and that is okay. You aren't broken. 
13. Some people will never get it and that is okay too. 
14. It is never okay to push your OCD onto others. Forcing others into compulsions, using others solely for reassurance and spilling out extremely disturbing thoughts to them without consent is not okay. OCD isn't your fault, but you are in charge of how you handle it. OCD is not only hard on the sufferer but can be very hard for those around them too. Seeing someone in stuff mental torture can be sad. 
15. Chances are, you are overreacting to most things. OCD can make serious mountains out of mole hills. Various people with OCD have truly believed they're criminals for very minor things. It distorts your logic THAT badly. 
16. For those who menstruate, OCD tends to flare up even worse around this time. I have seen it a lot and experienced it myself so you are not alone at all. 
17. You may start to worry one day if your intrusive thoughts no longer bother you. That is also another OCD trick. Pay it no mind. Accept the fear is there but don't let it control you into compulsions again. 
18. Moments of clarity are a thing and they are amazing. Enjoy them when they happen. 
19. Be easy on yourself. You deserve peace, rest, food and love no matter what your OCD is saying to you. You are not a bad person. 
20. Compulsions feel amazing but they do not ever help you, they only make you get deeper and deeper into a cycle until you're stuck and in a beyond horrified state. Don't give into them. Look up ERP techniques or get a therapist that specializes in OCD solely. 
21. Remember, you are dealing with one of the most debilitating illnesses (This was said by the WHO). Don't be so hard on yourself. Show yourself some compassion. You deserve it.",47,0

It feels like one part compulsion, one part a convenient excuse not to eat. 

My eating disorder is tied deep into my OCD. I use compulsions to fill up time so I don’t have to stop and eat. I’d always rather go forward instead of sitting with my thoughts. I rely heavily on distraction to get through meals, but it’s really easy for that to spin out and control my day. 

Social media feels like a catch-22: it reminds me of all the friends I’ve made, and reminds me of how stagnant I am now as I slowly recover from this eating disorder. I want to feel less lonely, but I can’t tell if Instagram makes me feel more or less alone.",14,0

I don't know what to do.,11,pr75o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/pr75o0/i_want_to_rehome_my_kitten_largely_because_of_my/,14,1632055091.0,"I already know that I'm the problem. The cat is nice, I'm the asshole, and I made a bad, irresponsible choice. I already feel so guilty and awful, so I would be really appreciative if you don't pile on. I already know. I am just hoping to connect with some people who can hopefully understand what OCD feels like, and maybe get some advice. I'm sorry for how long this is. For context, I have pretty bad contamination-focused OCD comorbid with GAD and panic attacks.

My husband and I have been together for 10 years and the whole time we have talked about wanting to get a cat, but it never felt like the right time. Recently, we moved into a two bedroom apartment with a spot for a litterbox. Our landlord loves animals; I did endless hours of cat research; I made room for it in our budget; I walked around our house making verbal ""cat-proofing"" notes, designing a ""base camp"" room (Jackson Galaxy method) in my head. We used to live with his family cat before, and we loved it. That cat never bothered my OCD; I actually found her very therapeutic. Everything seemed right, so we contacted a rescue.

I told the rescue that we were homebodies who wanted a chill, lazy, relaxed cat. Ideally young enough to not be ""set in their ways"" and to not have crazy medical bills yet, but I didn't want a crazy, energetic, playful cat. I know that because of my OCD, I have a pretty low psychological tolerance for mischief and chaos. To me, the outside world is painful, contaminated, and dirty; the unpredictability, lack of control, and need to constantly mask my anxiety is excruciating and exhausting. Home was always my safe, clean, controllable, predictable oasis. Despite my inner struggles, I cope well and have a normal, successful life. Prior to getting this cat, I was the happiest I'd ever been. But a big part of my coping strategy is having my ""sanctuary"" to decompress in, where I can experience a total relief from that anxiety.

The Wednesday after I applied, the rescue called me the very next day, asking if I could pick a cat up that weekend: an 11 week old kitten. It was really abrupt. She's so sedate, they said; she just cuddles and sleeps. She's the unique kind of kitten that is so relaxed, she doesn't even need another cat to keep her company. My husband instantly fell in love. We agreed to adopt the cat.

The night before we got her, this crushing wall of anxiety hit me. I frantically sobbed, and I told my husband over and over again that I didn't want to adopt the cat, that I regretted what I'd committed to, and I couldn't do it. I wanted to let the shelter keep our $300 adoption fee as a donation and find her a different family. But he was already in love with the cat, and convinced me that I was just having nervous cold feet and it would be fine.

Unfortunately, I think that the shelter was mistaken on her personality, my husband was mistaken on the lasting nature of my ""cold feet"", and I should have listened to my gut.

We've had her for a couple of weeks now, and I have sobbed with anxiety every single night. I haven't had panic attacks this bad in years. I logically recognize that she's a normal kitten with normal kitten behaviours, but I feel under seige. I'm miserable. I haven't felt relaxed or unreservedly happy since she got here. I'm so distracted by obsessive thoughts about her that I can't follow the plots of simple movies, let alone perform well at work. I can't decompress when she's near me, and even when she's in a different room I'm just preoccupied about what she could be doing in there. Every day I spend time trying to play, cuddle, and bond with her, but inevitably I get quickly overwhelmed and have to lock myself away from her. I'm so scared she'll destroy things - even things I don't have a particular attachment to, it terrifies me and feels so violating for no logical reason. I'm scared she'll eliminate inappropriately, or I'm thinking about her paws tracking poo germs all over me and my home. I have to wash my hands every time I touch her. It never felt like this with the previous cat, and I don't understand why it feels like that this time. But it does.

On top of the ""me problems"", I am growing worried that she's just not a good personality fit regardless of my OCD. For the first few days, she *was* super peaceful and sedate, like the shelter said. But I think that was just nervousness. With every day, as she's grown more comfortable with us and her environment, she's gotten increasingly hyper.

Tonight, within 30 minutes of me letting her out of ""base camp"", she had torn up the landlord's curtains and scratched my couch and chairs, despite me constantly redirecting to her 4 scratching posts; chewed my phone, laptop, headphones, Nintendo Switch, eyedrops, chapstick, charging cords, and pens, despite me taking these things away from her and redirecting to an interactive toy every single time; bitten and scratched me repeatedly; tried to eat about ten lethal things including the tape holding our electrical cords down and *the paint off the walls;* and ran a hundred laps over me and my head and my laptop, lunging at my face and trying to eat my hair and necklace. This is what it's like EVERY SINGLE WORKING DAY for several hours. She only clings to me; she doesn't like my husband as much, as mean as that sounds to say particularly given the circumstances. Increasingly, I feel like she's only ""peaceful"" when she's conked out asleep. The rest of the time, she's either full-tilt crazy playful or she's so enthusiastically, energetically cuddly that it kind of feels aggressive - if your hand is at rest for a single moment, she swan-dives into it to be pet. It's so adorable, but (again, I know this is a ""me problem"") it's too much for me.

I know that a lot of her mischief is normal kitten behaviour. I know that she'll probably grow out of it by age 2-3. And I know that other people would beat down my door to get such a loving cat. But when I agreed to adopt her, I thought that she *wasn't* your average crazy kitten; I thought she was an old soul. She seems lonely and bored. And I don't think I can do two to three more years of this - let alone 15 to 20 if this is just her personality. I think she needs more playful owners - maybe a family with kids? - or a home with other cats to keep her company and help get her growing energy out. Getting a second cat is out of the question. I think that the restrictions I would want to put on her as a compromise, like keeping her alone in a ""kitten room"" when I need to focus on work and at night so she doesn't destroy the house and I don't worry about her killing herself by eating something stupid, are inhumane and cruel, and she would be better off with someone more capable of loving her kitten years.

My husband says to give it more time, I'll get used to it, and I understand why he says that. He's heartbroken, furious, and desperate to keep her. But I honestly think that will make things worse. I don't think I'll feel any differently if we wait, but I *do* think that with every week she ages she becomes less easily re-adoptable. He'll get more and more attached, and it will hurt him more; and the cat will also get more attached, making rehoming more traumatizing for it. I feel like I'm being asked to choose between keeping my husband of 10 years and having my OCD triggered 24/7 for the next decade plus. I know that people on here will say ""he should keep the cat and rehome you, you monster"" but I just feel so crushingly sad and anxious and guilty. Despite this, and not to minimize his pain, but I also feel kind of betrayed that it seems like my husband of 10 years is choosing an animal he met a few weeks ago over my mental health, suffering, and honestly maybe our relationship. I don't know what to do. I want to return the kitten while she's young and cute, and use the opportunity to get serious about seeking more fulsome OCD treatment, so maybe one day we can have a chance at adopting a (genuinely chill) senior cat/adult cat in future. But he wants me to try to tough it out. What should we do?",11,0

My husband and I are thinking our son could potentially have OCD. We have always recognized some anxiety in him but lately things have gotten a bit worse and as I learn about OCD it's not exactly what I had thought. 

He is currently dealing with:

Intrusive sexual thoughts - they don't seem to bother him but I think he's confused by them and we're definitely confused about where they came from. 

He asks for assurance about seemingly small things - examples: do you think I should eat this broccoli? Will I still be healthy if I don't? I may jump if a dog barks! (when we suggested sleeping with the windows open when he was hot.) Do you think a dog will bark?! Do you think I should wear pants today to school? It's cold now but warming up later. What if I'm too hot in pants when it warms up?

Our answer is never what he wants to hear - if we answer ""yes we think you should eat your broccoli"", he freaks out because he doesn't want to eat it. If we say we will leave it up to him, he freaks out because he wants us to ""just tell me!"". If I say it's okay if he doesn't eat vegetables for a day, he'll ask again if he'll still be healthy. 

He confesses to us things he does that he knows he shouldn't be doing - teasing his sister, cutting a shirt, coloring on the carpet, etc etc. 

He wipes his butt probably 20 times after he poops. 

He loses his mind with any bit of disappointment or having to hear no, or not right now. He screams, flails, kicks, sometimes even pushes, throws, hits. 

At school he's absolutely fine. He's social, has fun, follows directions and as far as I know is not struggling. We have parent teacher conferences in two weeks so I'm curious to see what the teacher has to say but so far her comments to me have been positive. This is where I'm the most confused. Is it possible for OCD or anxiety in general to be controlled in certain situations or environments?

We are trying our best to have patience with him but we feel like we can't say anything right or do anything right. We're at a loss and are not sure if we'd be laughed out of a psychologist's office or if it's worth getting him evaluated.",12,0

And to be perfectly honest, it’s the beginning of a new school year, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said, I’m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.

So, right now everything seems dark and you don’t see a way out. That’s ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When’s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can’t remember or it’s been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can’t sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you’re hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it’s been a while. Call someone. It doesn’t matter who, just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When’s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that’s OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.",248,0

When I was in my junior year of college, I was hospitalized after staying awake for several weeks straight completing “just right” compulsions. At the hospital, a social worker asked me about my history with SSRIs. I told her that I had been on Prozac for a while in high school but that I felt too sugary sweet so I went off it. She asked me if I’d rather feel how I felt when I was hospitalized or “too sugary sweet.” That’s when I went back on Prozac. 

At the lower levels, it was incredibly difficult for me to do exposures or take the time to reflect on why I was doing my compulsions. I’m on 100mg now, which is obviously a pretty high dose, and it’s made it possible me to work on these things in therapy. 

So here are the several points about SSRIs I want to make:

1) Nobody should be telling you to take an SSRI as a cure-all. They’re supposed to be taken in conjunction with other treatments, i.e. therapy.

2) Along this same vein, the goal is eventually to take you off of the SSRIs. They are getting you to a level where you can make it through treatment.

3) You need to be on a very high level of SSRIs for it to impact your compulsions. This goes along with it not being a cure-all. It’s just supposed to make things a little better.

I am in graduate school now, and I wouldn’t be here if nothing had changed. SSRIs haven’t cured me, but they’ve helped me in therapy and given me the freedom to keep living my life while I’m working on my OCD. 

As you can guess from the not sleeping story, my OCD has been pretty bad. Last year, I spent 8 months in a residential OCD center. Therapy has been the BULK of my work, but it’s been work that I’ve only been able to do based on my SSRIs.",131,0

I constantly checked everything from doorknobs, to burners, and everything had to be exact (my bank account couldn’t go off budget, things had to be in order, I had to feel happy all the time in my relationship, the list goes on). Finally I decided to check again if this was possibly ocd through NOCD. I still was in denial even after that. But then I started doing my first exercises of ERP. 

It was very tough but I started to see a bit of a light at the end of the tunnel. I was able to label these intrusive thoughts and anxieties. I also was able to manage the fears and lean further into uncertainty when I usually avoided it.

Not because of my OCD. actually a bad person. I’m pretty sure I have Covert NPD. I want to change this. There are a few events from my past I want to discuss I guess and receive opinion and insight on. I’m scared to discuss them with my therapist. I’m scared to move on. The mistakes on my mind are as following:

I dissociate from my emotions, because of this I used to lie and convince people I had feelings for them because I wanted love so so bad. I haven't actually had feelings for anybody in 5 years, and most of the crushes I've had have been strictly vain. I would try to push myself to experience ""love"" and emulate them because I wanted to feel that emotion. I do want love. I crave attention and that's something I still struggle with, I hate it. There's one person I met off of a dating app recently. I discussed with them how I do have a personality disorder. I did not state it being NPD. I told them I wanted to keep things on a platonic level because I know what I'm capable of. I still want and crave their attention and vaguely flirt with them out of instinct. It almost makes me want to cut them off because they don't know the real me. They're never going to know the real me. I wish I could have normal, non-exploitive relations with people. They're so fucking nice to me man. There's things about my past I know they would not want to interact with me over and I can't tell them. I feel manipulative and selfish for this but I don't want to cut this person out of my life. 

I have also stolen money from my family. Not intentionally. I mean to pay them back I just don't due to being extremely low income and I hate doing it, which is very bad I know. I can barely even afford to go to therapy. I'm very grateful they have helped me somewhat but they are also part of the reason I ended up this way. I'm envious of my cousins for being raised in a normal household. Containing the ability to have intimate emotional connections with people. I want that. I want to be able to experience that. I hope to be able to eventually work towards it but I'm scared to move forward. 

I exhibit slight BPD traits as well such as favorite person-ing people and trying to keep people in my life from leaving, but I guess those could fall under NPD as well, who knows. I used to see this one person for about 3 years actually. We never officially dated but I met them before I was self aware. They had a tendency to cut people off when they were in a bad spot mentally and I couldn't handle that. Not receiving a response from someone drives me crazy. I've calmed down a little bit from that but sometimes it still freaks me out. I would go off on them for ignoring me, they would sometimes ignore me for weeks at a time. Then we would reconnect and they would apologize to me. This went on for years. I don't want to get into exactly what it was but they had a specific kink and it involved fetishizing me. They felt really bad about having it but because of my insecurity and because I wanted them to be into me I would lie and tell them I was into it. They still don't know. I want to tell them but I know they would be so upset. I did this to a ton of people with the same interest. All stemming from my insecurity. I didn't at the time comprehend this being wrong. In my head I thought, ""They're into this, it's fine, they want me and want to do this."" This is where things get pretty rough with that. One person I lied to. They, I suspect, also have NPD but in a more overt way. I remember one conversation I had with them where we both said we didn't have feelings for each other but would be jealous if we were seeing anybody else. Basically what I did was I lied to them as well. They had told me that they had never done anything related to they kink and that they wanted to do it with someone who SPECIFICALLY was into it. I lied to them and told them I was. We did stuff related to it and then I felt really bad about lying. I then told them how I had lied to them about being into it. They told me how I manipulated them and how they were really upset with me for what I did. At the time I thought they were overreacting. In my brain I thought, what, why does it matter, it was something you were interested in. They eventually told me they forgave me but I'm not too sure if they really did. 

These following three stories are honestly the worst for me to admit to myself. Basically when I was 18 I had sex with someone off of tinder I had matched with the night prior. I go to pick them up, they are drinking a box of wine that they had apparently been drinking either since the night prior or that morning? (foggy story can't remember exact details). They had about a half to a fourth of a box left and drank it throughout the day of us hanging out and were definitely drunk. We ended up going to a house show later that night and ended up back at my place. I don't drink keep in mind, I also have OCD. I had sex with them and made sure they were okay with it because of my OCD and paranoia and to I guess rationalize everything? but the fact that I did that while they were drinking and because I wanted to have sex with them feels, so gross. They are okay with everything that happened but I would never have sex with someone drinking ever again and didn't realize it was morally reprehensible. I feel like I guess I rationalized it for my benefit if that makes sense? And that's what I feel guilty for. I didn't think of it like that in the moment but I don't know. I definitely did rationalize it. I did have sex with one other person while they were drinking also while I was 18. My roommate had accused me of sexually assaulting them for it but the person I actually had sex with does not feel that way (actually still in vague contact with this person but we don't really talk) and they are okay with everything that happened. My roommate had met them before I had sex with them and said they felt like the person couldn't have consented. What had happened was the person originally texted me asking if I wanted to have sex, this is someone I have had sex with before, I said sure, then said they had been drinking, and I was like oh alright are you okay to drive or something of the sort (again, foggy memory, I was definitely uncomfortable that they had been drinking I think but I tried to rationalize it) they said they would walk to my place because they couldn't drive (lived in the city at the time) I assumed it would be fine and did have sex with them. Keep in mind I also have OCD, right before we did anything my brain was like you're taking advantage of them and you want to take advantage of them and it felt like I actually did but I pushed that thought and feeling aside but I felt really bad and gross inside for feeling that and tried to distract myself from that I guess you could say. I always told myself that that thought and feeling was my OCD and not my personality disorder, but what if that's wrong. What if I really felt that way. I know myself to know I would never intentionally sexually assault them or anybody for that matter but I guess it's the fact that that emotion and feeling appeared in my brain. 

This one was another incident from when I was 18 I feel bad over even though nothing had happened and it was all internalized. There was this person we will call person A. Person A said they wanted to have sex with me and person B who I was kind of seeing at the time. I told person B and they were like yeah we should. Anyways we go to hang out with person A and they are drinking. We didn't do anything with them because person B said they were way too drunk to do anything and I feel bad not I guess recognizing that at first until they said it. I can't remember how I reacted inside whether it was yeah oh my god you're right or oh damn. I think that could be partially the OCD talking because I did have an OCD fixation where I was scared of having sexually assaulted people. 

I just want to know I guess, is there hope for me to change and become a good person. I want to be. I’m just haunted by what I’ve done. I’m also curious if this is stuff I could tell my therapist because I don’t want to be reported.",10,0

1399,Just heard amazing advice.,101,qelwfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qelwfk/just_heard_amazing_advice/,10,1635054006.0,"Honestly I think this advice is going to change my life. It’s for intrusive thoughts/ruminating.

So, OCD is so anxiety producing because it attacks the things you *value*. Contamination/illness OCD? Maybe you value health or value cleanliness. Harm OCD? Maybe you value the well-being of others. POCD? You value the lives of children. Moral OCD? You value being a good person. So, OCD is your brain finding a thought that caused a negative reaction + we took an action to try and rid ourselves of that feeling the *thought* produced. That alone solidified to the brain that said thought was scary. 

This man on Tik Tok (I think he got the advice from a man named Mark Freeman on YouTube? I guess he was just sharing it) said to stop this cycle by not *avoiding the fear but adding the value*. 

Moral OCD? Add the value of the wellbeing of others by choosing to volunteer. Health OCD? Add the value of health by prioritizing a healthy diet or starting yoga. Ignore the thoughts, don’t engage with them, and at first it will be uncomfortable but eventually your brain learns it wasn’t anything to fear. 

Maybe this isn’t as helpful to y’all as me but I’ve never thought about pulling an uno reverse card on OCD and deciding to turn it into a *positive* thing toward my values. Idk. Hope this is helpful to somebody.",101,0

Holy moly. I recent had an OCD 'melt-down' so to speak, and I think it was largely caused by Vitamin D deficiency (I was working 12 hour 14 day swings in an office... That's another topic). Anyway, I started researching vitamin D and went down the rabithole.

I got myself a number of vitamins today - vitamin b12, vitamin d and magnesium. After taking them I've almost stopped ruminating entirely, I've actually cleaned up the house a bit which was unthinkable yesterday - I feel so much better. I'm going to try and get myself folate and l-theanine as well as they're meant to be of benefit as well. 

It could all be placebo, but given that there's scientific evidence that these vitamins are of benefit to those with OCD I'm going to stick with it. I'm also pretty frustrated that these weren't raised by any medical professional I've seen to date. I'll update this post over the next few days to say whether the effect was short-lived or if I'm still feeling better.",63,0

I just constantly go back and stare at it in my cart and get extremely anxious about pressing buy cause, what if it's not right or I don't like it or it comes damaged, or it isn't what I need/wanted, etc. I'll spend hours to months researching and reading reviews and this even continues after I actually purchase the item; always doubting if it was the right purchase.

This extends to buying things in physical stores as well. I will walk around with things to buy and just continue to doubt myself and put it back and pick it up again, walk around some more. Sometimes walking out without it and then coming back a few days later.

Just curious to see if any of you do something similar. I've been struggling to buy a new pair of much-needed glasses for the past few days,  but I just can't seem to bring myself to hit buy.

I don’t ask for help on Reddit often but I am at a complete loss. An immediate family member I live with got positive covid test results today. Covid germs spreading is one of my main contamination fears. I’m not scared of health issues, I’m terrified of the disgust and feeling like germs are crawling all over my clean things that make me feel safe. 

Want to know the ironic thing? The only reason she got the test was because of my OCD. She has had minor cold symptoms. No cough whatsoever. My rational self said there’s absolutely no way this is covid because it’s so minor and we are all vaccinated. OCD said “make her get a test because your life will be ruined if she brings covid into the house”. She wanted to cancel but I made her go and what do you know it’s positive. My OCD could have quite literally kept people from catching covid and dying today. 

On the other hand, my clean world is ruined because I slept in my bed and touched stuff in my room with covid germs on me. I had a horrible anxiety attack after finding out. I’m scared to breathe the air in my house. I feel like I can’t even step foot in my room ever again, I’m scared to even touch my face, I’ve been avoiding touching all doorknobs and surfaces in my house for like 6 hours now. I’m scared to eat food the person with covid has touched. I feel like my room is covered in filth. I feel like I’m covered in filth. The anxiety is so bad that I’m seriously questioning how much longer I can stand living like this. My life was already miserable but this is completely unbearable.

I am enraged about this. I told this person so many times to be more careful and wear a mask because of what a disaster it would be for my OCD if any of us got Covid. I have been constantly screamed at and mocked and treated with cruelty for reassurance seeking around covid. Now I feel like I was in the right and not even being unreasonable asking people to wear masks. My family member has been spending time unmasked inside with a senior who lives in a nursing home and an antivaxxer. I explained so many times what a disaster this would be and my family was careless and I can’t help but feel like no one took my mental illness seriously and no one cares about my well-being. 

Has anyone with contamination OCD (or other kinds) had a situation like this where their OCD was triggered so badly that it feels like it can’t be repaired? I would need to disinfect every nook and cranny in my house, mop the walls, wash every article of clothing, disinfect every piece of furniture, etc. to ever feel clean again and thats just not possible to do.

Every footstep.  The housing office said they got a noise complaint a few months ago, and ever since then, I've been very careful about making noise.  Too careful, to the point where it's hard to relax.  I am up early, during quiet hours, and often find myself literally walking on my toes.  Literally.  Because I don't want to disturb anyone.  

# An Unwelcome Visitor

The other day I was listening to an audiobook while doing dishes.  Normally I would wear headphones, but I get tired of having them in all the time.  During quiet hours I must use headphones,  and at the current time it's outside quiet hours, so I felt it would be OK to listen on my speakers.  It was turned up just enough so I could make out the words over the running water.

Suddenly, I hear a BANG BANG BANG like the sound of a cannon.  I compare it to the sound of a cannon because it was LOUD.  I jumped and instantly felt the flood of addrenalin caused by the sudden booming.  I soon realized it was coming from my door.  I stopped the audiobook and looked through the peephole to find a man.  We'll call him John-- the tenant who lives in the unit below me.  He looked furious. He then talked to me through the door:

*""Turn that f\*\*\*ing thing off right f\*\*\*ing now.  I mean it.  I am tired of you constantly stomping around.  If you don't cut it out I'm going to come up here and bash your f\*\*\*ing head in.""*

I was too shaken to respond, and he turned around and left.  

# The Aftermath

I immediately called the housing office to report it, and then I called the police to file a report.  The police showed up at my unit a few minutes later, and had me explain it again.  The officer was very sympathetic and said he's lived in an apartment before and knows that every footstep can be heard below.  

He went down to have a chat with John, who denied coming up to talk to me, but did grumble about the noise.  The officer knew he was lying but couldn't do much since I had no evidence and my description of the man was vague (I haven't seen him enough and I was too shaken to remember what he was wearing). The officer was clever though and said to John, *""If you happen to hear of anyone banging on someone's door and making threats, be sure to remind them that this is illegal and can result in an arrest.""*

The officer came back to me and recounted his conversation with John.  It is a little comforting to know that John has now probably been scared into never doing that again.  The housing office also said they would address it with him, though could not give me any details.  

# My Thoughts

It was likely an empty threat.  I don't know the man well.  And I don't think he even knows what I look like, which is comforting.  I do know the neighborhood well, and it is a very safe neighborhood.  Lots of families and retired people.  Crime rates are very low.

I do not want to bend to his threat in any way.  I should be able to listen to something on my speakers during non-quiet hours without being afraid of someone trying to hurt me.  But part of me wonders if I should actually just move out.  I hate to do that since I love where I live now (except for my downstairs neighbor).  Any other place would be not be in as good of a location, and would not fit my needs the way my current place does.  Right now I am home.  

I can't fathom how someone would be so unreasonable.  He bangs on my door as hard as he can, and makes demands and threats due to my normal living noises.  The irony here is that out of every sound that has ever come from my unit, the loudest by far was the banging on my door.  The noise HE made!

# The Question

It's been about a week, but I can't stop ruminating on it, especially when I make a noise that may be heard below (which is pretty much every footstep).  Should I just move out? Or should I accept that this happened, but I am not in any real danger?",25,0

I just joined reddit today. 

My goal is to engage in a new way with the OCD community. 

In my day job, I engage with OCD sufferers as clients, and this places certain limitations on our interactions. Like all relationships, therapists and clients step into roles. There are things that clients will tell me that they don't tell others. And there are things that clients tell others that they won't tell me. 

So I came to this place that probably has the most raw and honest dialogue about OCD. 

I came here to learn.... I want to learn by observing what people find comforting and supportive. 

At times I might ask some questions to get a sense of the community's attitudes and perspectives on certain aspects of OCD that are not commonly discussed. 

At times I might ""test out"" blog post ideas by sharing educational concepts and analogies, and seeing how people respond. 

I hope that joining this community will help me become a better therapist and educator to my clients and the OCD community.",670,0

Despite the fact that I’ve been a complete mess bawling, anxiety attacks, begging her to isolate in her room, shaking, etc she refuses to follow reasonable CDC guidelines. She won’t even wear a mask when walking around our house. It’s not like I’m acting on OCD and asking her to move out of the house or anything. 

My OCD has never been worse, anxiety is at an entirely unbearable level. At first I tried to approach the situation as kindly, calmly, and reasonably as I could even though in reality I’m having severe extreme anxiety 24/7. My mom told me I was “talking to her like she’s a 5 year old” and walked away mid conversation. 

I couldn’t keep it together anymore and had a total breakdown crying, trying so hard to explain why this situation is such a disaster in front of my dad after my mom walked away. He was being completely void of empathy, telling me to calm down, that I need to learn how to “cope” (even though I’m the only one in the family who has been in mental health treatment, going on 9 years now).

I noticed he was speaking strangely, not raising his voice too much, not using his usual hateful tone, not being as cruel as usual. I noticed he was recording me. I grabbed his phone and sure enough he’s recording me. So I don’t know what the hell to do now. I’m in a house with someone with covid actively exposing me to it 24/7, OCD is so debilitating I can’t do or touch anything, and my dad is being emotionally manipulative. Currently feeling totally betrayed, like no one cares about my mental or physical health, and honestly suicidal and like there is no way to get out of this horrible situation.",11,0

1430,my partner is getting tired of being asked for reassurance so i’m keeping it to myself for today,10,qotrfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qotrfn/my_partner_is_getting_tired_of_being_asked_for/,7,1636307429.0,"I have many many OCD themes but a big one is my cat’s health. A few years ago I neglected cleaning his litter box for long periods of time because I was very dysfunctional and sick. But the more I neglected it, the guiltier I felt, which made me neglect it more. My cat has (probable) asthma now and I don’t know if it’s from my neglect or something else but I feel terrible about it all the time. 

I usually ask my partner for reassurance (when should i go to the vet? do you think he’s fine? do you think it’s because of me?) etc etc but recently it’s gotten out of control and i will ask for reassurance over and over and over again, even asking the same things. A couple of times he has gotten mad at me because he’s tired of being asked. Then i get really sad because he’s angry. 

I’m just gonna keep quiet today. Which feels so alone and terrible, I can’t even describe how bad it feels. But i would rather deal with OCD alone than OCD and also my partner getting upset with me. 

I know this is the “healthy” thing to do when it comes to OCD (resist compulsions) but I’m really sad today and feel like I killed my cat. And it’s only a matter of time before I come home and he’s just dead on the couch or something. Please send hugs to me today",10,0
