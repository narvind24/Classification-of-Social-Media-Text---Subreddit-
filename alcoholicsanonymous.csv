I woke up at 5am, did my prayer and went to the gym. I came back home after. The funny thing is I literally sat on my couch thinking about what to do next üòÇ 

Usually I am laying in bed till 2pm struggling to get up...struggling to even eat unless there is a bottle left over from the night before (almost never). Then, I would get on my Snapchat and figure out who to hangout  with to drink with. I don‚Äôt drink everyday but on the weekends I binge. Sometimes it continues pass Sunday. I have called out of work Monday so many times, I am lucky to still have a job. 

I have taken steps to in deleting my social media apps because it gives me urge to drink when I see friends hanging out. Even sometimes the music I listen to. Watch out for that too. Which is why I mostly just use Reddit. 

I know I‚Äôm just going on a rant, but I stalk this community and I really appreciate everyone‚Äôs story. It really gives me a perspective on how ugly alcohol is. I definitely lost relationships, been to jail (thank god nothing serious). The last time I ran into cops from drinking was when me and my brother were drinking and driving one night. I decided to drive because we were close to being home. I went down a hill 45mph and because it was wet out I slammed into a fence bad. It was a sharp turn and I just went straight. I decided to leave the scene (beyond stupid I know but I was drunk so what isn‚Äôt stupid when your drunk ü•¥) As I parked the car at my parents drive way I walked towards the park to think about everything. Then I seen the lights. It was the cops. He asked me if I hit a fence (he told me he found out it was me because the radiator oil was leaking and he traced it to my parents houseü§£). I said yes and that I was going to walk back to talk to the owner. Long story short, the homeowner was nice enough to not press charges and just wanted to get his fence fixed. I did not get a DUI or hit and run charge which I still don‚Äôt know how. I ended up getting a $190 ticket for unnecessary speeding. I will definitely take that who wouldn‚Äôt. My brothers car got fixed and the fence from insurance. Definitely, had an angel looking after me no question. I realized I have a problem when ‚Äúbeing tipsy‚Äù is a joke to me. I don‚Äôt get how people go to bars to get a shot or two. When I drink, I drink till the next day. Then, I‚Äôm on my bed the whole next day. Alcohol isn‚Äôt fun for me anymore. All I do is spend money I don‚Äôt have and meet people who I don‚Äôt talk to the next day. I guess if it works for people it works. It is when YOU start to realize that the quick 2 hours of fun at the club isn‚Äôt worth the mistakes and trouble that come with it. Nope Never!!!

Anyways, thanks for listening to my rant!

And the kids are high on cake and pop. 
Grown ups are all drinking beer and wine... and the champagne just got popped. I just ran inside with my soda water, picked up my phone, and messaged my sponsor. I texted an AA friend. And I'm writing here.
I am going to go squeeze some lime juice into my soda water, breathe deeply a few times, and go back to join the party.

I can do this.

*additions*:

And I did do this.

Someone pulled out a joint, and that was more than I was ready to deal with (I used to enjoy pot too), so I gathered up the kids, and went home.

The kids and I had a fun bath time I read them stories, they went to sleep...
Then at 9pm my husband came home - he was pretty wasted, but in a 'good' way. He said our friends were still going strong, but he was done. This is how I know he's not an alcoholic. I would have been the last person to leave. He walked away when he was finished.

Anyway, I looked at him, all glazed eyes and slightly staggering, and I felt SO FUCKING GOOD. I will go to an exercise class at 7:30 tomorrow morning, and kick some serious cardio arse. 

My sponsor messaged me to say well done. My AA buddy texted me back to tell me they were proud of me.

Thank you to all who commented here too - I appreciate it so very much.",58,0

I am less self-centered.  The world used to revolve around me at the center.  I cared more about my own needs, desires and my own pleasure, my own way, myself than I did about the whole rest of the world.  What happened to me was more important than anything else I could think of.  I was selfishly trying to be happy and therefore I was unhappy most of the time.  I have found that selfishly seeking pleasure does not bring true happiness.  Thinking of myself all the time cut me off from the best in life.  A.A. taught me to care less about myself and more about the other person.  Am I less self-centered?

Meditation

When something happens to upset you and you are discouraged, try to feel that life's difficulties and troubles are not intended to arrest your progress in the spiritual life, but to test your strength and to increase your determination to keep going.  Whatever it is that must be met, you are to either overcome it or use it.  Nothing should daunt you for long, nor should any difficulty entirely overcome or conquer you.  God's strength will always be there, waiting for you to use it.  Nothing can be too great to be overcome, or if not overcome, then used.

In the beginning, it was four whole years before A.A. brought permanent sobriety to even one alcoholic woman. Like the ""high bottoms,"" the women said they were different; A.A. couldn't be for them. But as the communication was perfected mostly by the women themselves, the picture changed.

This process of identification and transmission has gone on and on. The Skid-Rower said he was different. Even more loudly, the socialite (or Park Avenue stumblebum) said the same -- so did the artist and the professional people, the rich, the poor, the religious, the agnostic, the Indians and the Eskimos, the veterans, and the prisoners.
But nowadays all of these, and legions more, soberly talk about how very much alike all of us alcoholics are when we admit that the chips are finally down.

Few of us are any longer afraid of what any newcomer can do to our A.A. reputation or effectiveness.  Those who slip, those who panhandle, those who scandalize, those with mental twists, those who rebel at the program, those who trade on the A.A. reputation - all such persons seldom harm an A.A. group for long.

Some of these have become our most respected and best loved.  Some have remained to try our patience, sober nevertheless.  Others have drifted away.  We have begun to regard the troublesome ones not as menaces, but rather as our teachers.  They oblige us to cultivate patience, tolerance, and humility.

I started going to meetings and ended up in treatment. I got sober after that for almost a year, then relapsed, then got sober again for about 4 months and then went back out when I was 22 and didn‚Äôt come back to AA until four years later, after I had a heart attack. I knew if I kept drinking and using that I would probably end up dead so I came back to AA but I didn‚Äôt change anything about my day to day environment, so I relapsed after a couple of months.  

Fast forward to four years later - I‚Äôm 30 and I meet a woman who makes me want to clean my act up, so I do - sort of.  I had a job where I traveled a lot so when I was out of town I would binge drink and then when I was back home with her I would be really disciplined about my intake. This worked for about a year and a half but the toll it was taking on me physically and mentally started to eat at me. It was getting harder and harder for me to reel it in between the travel drinking and being home. On top of that, I couldn‚Äôt handle the fact that when I was with her and cutting myself off after a few drinks that I wanted more...sometimes to the point of feeling angry or sad about it - as weird as that sounds. I was seeing a therapist who suggested that I go to an AA meeting. So I did. I was secretly going to meetings and staying sober - telling my girlfriend that I was taking a break from drinking - and I stayed sober for a couple of months. I eventually came clean about my drinking and what was happening and she tried to be supportive but she doesn‚Äôt understand alcoholism and doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a thing. Me getting sober started to take a weird toll on my relationship and so eventually I started drinking again - with discipline and moderation - and that has been going on for about a month.

1. Exhaustion - Allowing oneself to become overly tired; usually associated with work addiction as an excuse for not facing personal frustrations.

2. Dishonesty - Begins with pattern of little lies; escalated to self-delusion and making excuses for not doing what's called for.

3. Impatience - I want what I want NOW. Others aren't doing what I think they should or living the way I know is right.

4. Argumentative - No point is too small or insignificant not to be debated to the point of anger and submission.

5. Depression - All unreasonable, unaccountable despair should be exposed and discussed, not repressed: what is the ""exact nature"" of those feelings?

6. Frustration - Controlled anger/resentment when things don't go according to our plans. Lack of acceptance. See #3.

7. Self-pity - Feeling victimized, put-upon, used, unappreciated: convinced we are being singled out for bad luck.

8. Cockiness - Got it made. Know all there is to know. Can go anywhere, including frequent visits just to hang-out at bars, boozy parties.

9. Complacency - Like #8, no longer sees value of daily program, meetings, contact with other alcoholics, (especially sponsor!), feels healthy, on top of the world, things are going well. Heck may even be cured!

10. Expecting too much of others - Why can't they read my mind? I've changed, what's holding them up? If they just do what I know is best for them? Leads to feeling misunderstood, unappreciated. See #6.

11. Letting up on disciplines - Allowing established habits of recovery - meditations, prayer, spiritual reading, AA contact, daily inventory, meetings - - to slip out of our routines; allowing recovery to get boring and no longer stimulating for growth. Why bother?!

12. Using mood-altering chemicals - May have a valid medical reason, but misused to help avoid the real problems of impending alcoholic relapse.

13. Wanting too much - Setting unrealistic goals: not providing for short-term successes; placing too much value on material success, not enough on value of spiritual growth.

14. Forgetting gratitude - Because of several listed above, may lose sight of the abundant blessings in our everyday lives: too focused on # 13.

15. ""It can't happen to me."" - Feeling immune; forgetting what we know about the disease of alcoholism and its progressive nature.

16. Omnipotence - A combination of several attitudes listed above; leads to ignoring danger signs, disregarding warnings and advice from fellow members.

I found my tribe, I made some headway through the steps(did not finish), and I haven‚Äôt had a drink in just shy of a year and a half. However, I have been smoking weed regularly the entire time.

Prior to this stint without a drink, I had made it a year dry. I had a bunch of false ideas of what the program really was. I thought it was a misery meeting, so I would not attend. I legitimately thought I was fixed, so I tried some controlled drinking. Hah! I had no idea I was already working a program. That led to about a year and a half of blackouts and burned bridges.

I was introduced to AA at a sober BBQ on July 4th 2018. I went to my first meeting shortly after, and officially put the bottle down on the 18th, and I haven‚Äôt gone back since.

I got really involved really quickly. I picked up whatever commitments I could at the meetings I went to, and even wound up on a YPAA committee. Plus I would speak just about every week at a halfway house type thing. Idle hands right?

The program reopened spiritual pathways for me that I had closed off for years. And God was right there to greet me, and bring me back into the fold. It brought me back to life!

But I felt like I was faking the funk, because I was getting stoned when I went home. I was hiding it from my sponsor, and everyone else in the rooms, except for the person I was romantically involved with.

This person and I ultimately broke up. The people around us were constantly in our business, and it was a kind of ugly break up.

I decided at that point to distance myself from the program. I have too much respect for it to only do it halfway, and honestly I have no desire to participate in the drama and side-taking.
That was just about 6 months ago.

27,Why are caffeine and nicotine perfectly acceptable to use but marijuana in an area where it is legal is not?,34,dxi5yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/dxi5yg/why_are_caffeine_and_nicotine_perfectly/,104,1573965482.0,"Tonight I went to a meeting and at the end they have a ""burning desires"" time where people who really want to use a substance can get things off of their chest. I mentioned that in the 2 and a half years that I have been sober my life has been great, but I work full time, am getting my masters full time, and planning my wedding. Some nights I just want to relax by smoking a little weed.

Marijuana has never been a problem for me, outside of its legality. I have been arrested with marijuana multiple times, but now that it is legal that won't be a problem.

I was the last to speak in the meeting, and immediately afterwards the guy next to me, who I casually know, told me that the reason I want to use so badly is that I am not working a proper program. I told him I go to meetings and volunteer with a group and he told me that I need to be sponsoring people etc or I am not really in AA. He's a big book thumper and I mentioned that the word ""sponsor"" appears no where in the first 164 and he stormed out. I'm not convinced that he has a grasp of my situation considering he is severely autistic and gets a check from the government, so he has no idea what coming home after a 12 hour day of work and school and following it up with several more hours of homework for weeks at a time is like. 

I don't drink caffeinated beverages and I don't smoke cigarettes. After the meeting several members came up to me telling me I need Marijuana Anonymous or that smoking weed will ruin my sobriety. I find that absurd considering I was in a crowd of people who were smoking and vaping and holding on to cups full of black coffee at 10pm.

I never have been told I have a problem, but have always been known as the one who likes to party, always down for a beer, out Wednesday-Sunday. 

I‚Äôve reached my lowest point. I‚Äôve been hiding my usage from everyone, which has pretty much been me getting drunk before hanging out with people or drinking so I can fall asleep on weekends. After a 3 day bender this weekend I spent the whole day in fear and anxiety. Instead of grabbing a drink I decided to google meetings in my area.

I sat in my car for 30 minutes outside the building sobbing not knowing if I should go in. But I did. I (f,22) was the youngest person there, but I‚Äôve never felt so validated and loved by random strangers before. I had no idea I would get a 24 hour chip, even though I haven‚Äôt been sober for 24 hours.

For me, a caring doctor, a recovery program with a proven track record of success, a band of brothers who carried me through early sobriety, and the grace of a higher power restored me to sanity.  

Now I can't imagine picking up a drink and sacrificing all the gifts sobriety has blessed me with.  Early recovery was really hard and even some times in sobriety have been challenging, but by focusing on doing the next right thing one day at a time, and by some miracle I can not explain, I find myself 5800 days past my last drink or drug.

I do not have a sobriety date, though I need one. Came into AA over 10 years ago, about 8.5 of which I've been sober (well, definitely just dry at times). I remember being 23 and unable to relate to the older folks who'd lost everything. Hell, I'd never gotten on well enough to gain anything in life at that point. Even at that tender age I had gone into liver failure (with the assistance of outside issues). Stuck around for 1.5 years, mostly loving life, then came down with terminally unique syndrome and went back out.

In early 2012, I hopped back on the wagon with desperation. I literally threw myself into it. Over the following 6 years I graduated college, began a career, got married, bought a house, and my son was born. Through practicing the principles my life became a dream come true. I thought I'd arrived, and I rested on my laurels. However, I was aware that something was missing. By Spring 2018, I relapsed on a somewhat ""manageable"" substance. By this I mean I managed to hide the habit from my wife until the Fall, when she caught me. She kicked me out of the house and asked for a divorce. We'd met in AA. So I got sober to win her back. It didn't happen. By this spring she was dating a guy from my old home group. Resentment set in and I felt sore at AA because its close-knit community made my humiliation fairly public.

I stayed sober for 9 months and started seeing a gal who liked to drink around 7 months in. It didn't bother me at first. Then one day I got the itch.

Fast forward to late October. My gf dumped me on a Monday and I got fired on Friday. I knew the firing at least was related to my drinking. Eager for comfort, I immediately got back with the gf yet continued to drink discretely because at least I had her. Thursday night, I drank 17 beers and texted her at 4am something out of line. It wasn't horrible, but I was horrified to remember it when I woke up Friday morning. I broke up with her at this time. I knew so long as I was focused on an already fragile relationship, I wouldn't focus on sobriety.

I start a new job tomorrow morning, one that pays significantly less than my last one, and my financial wreckage is bordering on impressive. I can't even figure out how I did it. Yet I've avoided detox because I need this job so bad that I can't afford to be a dt fool on day one.

The only thing I still have is my son half the week, thank God. I have to get it together, not just because of him, but because of me. I destroy myself every chance I get and it baffles me as much as it does everyone else, even my AA friends with time. I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to make ends meet, much less pay down my mountain of debt. I've become a low bottom drunk simply because I think I'm so damn smart and know better.

I am in touch with my old sponsor and going to a meeting tomorrow after work. This shit is real.",18,0

I turn 30 today, and more importantly to me, I have 5 full months of sobriety. My experience over the past 5 months have been nothing short of a miracle with the incredible help/support of my sponsor, my support system, family/friends, the program, my HP, and the willingness to do whatever I have to do to continue my sobriety. I was in a dark place when I finally sought help for my problems with alcohol and drugs, alcohol being the SOB that started & ended everything. I had very severe anxiety, didn't have any before my drinking career started, funny how that works, and I was depressed. Work was not going well, my performance was down the shitter, I was always late and hungover, I was short tempered with everyone including family, friends, work associates, etc. It got to the point of self-isolation, I knew no one wanted to be around me, even my drinking buddies. I couldn't function without alcohol, every single day, minute by minute, second by second, I was consumed with drinking, chasing the next drink, making a plan to get booze at different spots so the people working at the stores wouldn't find out my dark secret. It was a full time job plus some being an alcoholic, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

Today, the only way I can stay sober, is continuing to work the steps and attend meetings everyday of the week. I missed a meeting Sunday and yesterday, Monday, due to work, and my general anxiety had sky rocketed. I know I had to get to a meeting, to be around my people. I went to my usual Tuesday noon meeting today, and got my 5 month chip. There were a couple folks there that were new to the meeting, both newly sober with very little time. I could see the look of defeat in one of their faces, not knowing answers to their problems or how to overcome the emotions and feelings that they are experiencing. That too was me at one point, like a deer in the headlights, not know what would happen the next hour, minute, or second and if I would end up drinking or not. 

It has always a dream/goal of mine to have a birthday being completely sober and present in the day, and finally after all these years, it has finally happened at the age of 30, a new decade and outlook on life. I know most people/normies will say, ‚Äúhow can that be a dream of yours, just don‚Äôt drink!‚Äù Well, when you have been to the depths of hell I have been to, you would be thankful to escape the pits of death that were surrounding me and consuming my life.  

This is a long ramble, but thank you for reading. I am hitting another meeting tonight with my sponsor, even though I plan to make a nice dinner for myself, but that can wait. Anyone who is struggling, please reach out for help. It took me years to finally admit to someone besides myself that I had a problem and that their was a solution, you just have to be prepared and willing to take certain steps.

I started drinking at 13 which evolved into a fifth of whiskey a day and a hopeless addiction to opiates and amphetamines by the time I was 14. After multiple life threatening overdoses and a couple arrests, I finally became desperate enough to ask for help. I came into the rooms with absolutely no hope and by the way I had been using, if I didn‚Äôt come in when I did I would be dead by now without a doubt. I found a sponsor and I worked the steps and my life got better. I graduated high school in sobriety and made real connections with people. I got the job I want and the girl of my dreams and I woke up everyday without that sense of utter despair and tightness in my chest. And I forgot how bad it was. After I got a year of sobriety I started slipping and I didn‚Äôt realize how bad I was getting. I was resentful at my girlfriend, my family, my friends, and pretty much anyone I came into contact with. I stopped hitting meetings everyday and made excuses to get out of service work. I stopped 10.....then 11..... then barely did 12. I would have gone out and probably died if that had continued any longer than it did. After months of not being sure why I got sober I realized that I was seconds from throwing everything away and confessed to my sponsor that I wasn‚Äôt doing anything for my program. I surrendered again and it fucking hurt my ego even more than when I got sober. It‚Äôs been a little bit since then and I am coming up on 21 months of sobriety. I finally have gotten to the point where I have hope again. Life‚Äôs not perfect. No one works a perfect program. Don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out if you are struggling.

40,Been sober 7 weeks. I'm terrified to go to AA.,41,dzcmzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/dzcmzi/been_sober_7_weeks_im_terrified_to_go_to_aa/,40,1574303882.0,"I feel so lost and terrified and I don't know what to do. 

July of this year, my therapist asked me if I have issues with drinking. I flipped out and responded exactly like an addict from some cliche movie would. It took a while, but I eventually got a drug and alcohol assessment done. The hospital counselor recommended intensive outpatient therapy (3 hour sessions, 3x per week for a month). I haven't done that (not sure I can afford it), but I did completely quit drinking almost two months ago. It's the longest I have been sober in maybe five years and it's been rough...Like quitting smoking times 1,000.

My therapist REALLY wants me to go to AA. I have been extremely resistant to going. I sob intensely if I open up. It's better in therapy now, but it took months of powering through that to get to a point that that didn't happen for the entire session every session. 

I was severely psychologically abused as a child. I grew up in a religious cult and have a difficult time trusting others. I finally figured out I was in a cult when I was 17. The abuse was so severe that I was in a constant state of psychosis for nearly a decade. I was good enough at hiding the issues I had that no one knew. I grew up extremely isolated. The only people I ever opened up to as a child or teen were in that cult. I wasn't allowed to be honest with anyone outside of that cult. Since then, there are maybe two people in my life I have consistently been honest with about how I feel.

Eventually, I sought help for my psychological issues and was hospitalized. Now that I think about it, that's when I started drinking heavily.

I went to an AA meeting a few months ago. Sitting in a room with a bunch of strangers who opened themselves up and spoke about God reminded me so much of the cult I was in. People at the meeting were so kind to me, and I could barely look at them. I was so terrified of sobbing in the middle of the meeting or someone asking me ANYTHING.

I told my therapist I wasn't going back (I don't like opening up to people and there was too much religion in AA). She told me that isolation leads to addiction. I'm currently in therapy for something I thought was completely unrelated to alcohol. I had no intention of quitting drinking or talking about my alcohol use, but now here we are...

I know that I need to learn to open up to others. I know that I can just take the good things from AA, like working through the steps, and stay away from concepts that don't apply to me (like religion). I know that the first step is just GOING. That feels like a big first step to me.

I'm terrified. I want so badly to connect with others and I want so badly to be part of a group. Really, I just want a friend that I can be honest with about alcohol and the pain that drinking has caused me. I don't know where to start. I'm afraid of sobbing as soon as I get in the door and someone looks me in the eye.

I guess, I just want to know more about what it's like. Does anyone else who sobs a lot have an experience they can share? Could anyone else who was abused as a child tell me what it was like when they went for the first time, or opened up in a meeting for the first time? It feels like I have so much trauma that I am going to get there and it will be too much. Any other alcoholics with a lot of trauma who finally opened up?",41,0

SO on Monday night I went to my first meeting. It was scary, but what blew me away was how HONEST everyone was! You know telling a room of people your struggles and failures, and successes, is amazing because they're using the floor to be honest with themselves.  The humility blew me away.  After I shared a bit of my story, one fella went around getting phone numbers and names of everyone. Then he gave it to me with some AA pamphlets and a free Alcoholics Anonymous book.  Multiple people came and spoke to me after as well.  Then I went to coffee with the gentleman who gave me the book, and he introduced me to another gentleman.  It was such a positive experience.  

I attended my second meeting last night, I met more people.  It was nice.  I am thinking I'm gonna start showing up early to assist setting up. 

Anyways I just want to say thank you.  I have two people in mind for a sponsor but I'm hesitant on who to ask.  I'm also trying to fully accept my alcoholism.  Even though I know I have a problem, I keep trying to add an asterisk to it - I only binge and not often.  But that doesn't change anything.  So I'm working on that.

One Sunday in October, during my morning meditation, I glanced out the window at the ash tree in our front yard. At once I was overwhelmed by its magnificent, golden color! As I stared in awe at God's work of art, the leaves began to fall and, within minutes, the branches were bare. Sadness came over me as I thought of the winter months ahead, but just as I was reflecting on autumn's annual process, God's message came through. Like the trees, stripped of their leaves in the fall, sprout new blossoms in the spring, I had had my compulsive, selfish ways removed by God in order for me to blossom into a sober, joyful member of A.A.

I've had months sober many times, and have been in and out of sobriety for 7 yrs. In those years, I've been homeless, in shitty half-way houses and good ones. I've been down to Florida and back. I've OD'd countless times and twice in one day. I've caught very serious charges that have been posted online for anyone to see and frankly will be a part of my life for a long time. That shit was a direct result of active alcoholism or untreated alcoholism.

Heres whats different. I got out of the mental ward this summer after overdosing twice and ending up in the hospital twice in a day. I was so broken. I hated that I couldn't stay clean. I hated that I'd been to rehab at least 10 times. I hated that I let anyone who had ever care about me suffer. I was so powerless and didn't care if I died.

I got out of the psych ward and was let back into my parents house. I went to a meeting that first day and asked for help. From there my higher power took my hand. I met my sponsor. He took his time to help the sick and suffering alcoholic (me) and took me through the steps. It was hard and easy simultaneously. I didn't want to live like an untrustworthy junkie. I wanted to live, and be a good person. IT TOOK ME SEVEN YEARS TO BE HONEST AND DO THE STEPS. FUCK! I wish I had done it sooner. INSTEAD I DID IT LIKE A LAST RESORT. Like a dingbat. I wanted to try everything else besides following the steps. I'm not perfect, but I am a lot better. Here is what happened in those months since leaving the psych ward and trying these steps. 

I have a shitty job at a grocery store, but I have honor and accountability there.

I have spoken at several rehabs. To help those where I was so often sitting.

I am helpful to my elderly parents.

I fixed my credit and have a credit card (crazy to be honest).

I am a good partner.

I find myself praying whenever I am upset and angry, which is a miracle.

I'm GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND GETTING A's!!!!

I tried to take a college course while drinking and had to drop it. One course.

I went to a sick punk show and didn't think about drinking.

My life is slowly getting better and I'm helping others and bettering myself in ways I thought I would never get to.

YOU CAN TOO. GET A SERIOUS SPONSOR TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THE BIG BOOK. YOU WILL BE AMAZED.

Ask me anything. 

Thank you.",55,0

I am 160 days sober on the dot today and just turned 30 last week. Though I am still new to recovery, I have a pretty good program I am working, daily meetings, support from close family/friends, great sponsor, and am pretty close to the AA community where I live. My brother(who is also in the program) and myself will be attending Thanksgiving at one of our Uncles/Aunts house. Drinking is apart of that side of the family, they drink quite a bit, never to sloppiness or complete drunkardness, but they do indulge quite heavily. I know what I need to do to remain sober through this first Holiday get together and many more to come in the coming month. I should also mention that this side of the family does not know what my brother and I have been going through the past 6 months in regards to alcoholism/addiction, treatment, recovery program, etc. etc. I know what I need to do to remain sober, always have a drink in my hand, I don't need to let them know everything but just say I am not drinking today, have a backup plan, can check out early with a ""pre-planned event"", and going with a sober buddy, this case my brother. I feel like I know what to do, have been to other events/parties where alcohol has been and haven't been bothered by it or had a desire to drink. My parents live out of state and won't be here for Thanksgiving, but I had a conversation with my dad the other day and he started asking me questions like ""what will I do if they ask me if I want a drink? ,"" ""are you going to tell them what has been going on?"", ""Are you going to be able to not drink?""  I know he is looking out for me and wants the best, as a father does, but that was kind of a blow to hear from him. I have been completely abstinence for 5+ months, longest period of sobriety ever, and I know the holiday season is a time where alot of folks can relapse or go back out, but I don't have any desire to. I have a strong program and know I won't have any issues.

This is long and kind of random. I guess I would like to hear others experience, strength and hope regarding this. I heard this from an old timer at a meeting I attended a long time ago and it's always stuck with me regarding relapse/going back out. ""Just because you have free tickets to the circus, doesn't mean you have to attend.""

58,Kicking addicts out of a meeting,91,e24kmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/e24kmo/kicking_addicts_out_of_a_meeting/,120,1574802572.0,"Last week, I attended a closed women's mtg where one of the home group members asked someone who identified as an addict to leave.   Personally, I was flabbergasted/enraged.  (Note: I identify fully as an alcoholic).

Basically, a few girls were there from a treatment center and one of them identified as an addict when newcomers were invited to introduce themselves.   The group secretary then asked the girl who identified as an addict if she had a problem with alcohol.   She was a little shocked/put on the spot, and said no, and the secretary said ""sorry, you can't be here.""   She and her friends all walked out, more than blindsided.

I understand there are traditions.   I understand there is an entire pamphlet written by Bill that is devoted to explaining why we cannot help nonalcoholic addicts.   But, what the fuck?   The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.   Thus, the only question that seems appropriate to pose to ANYONE is ""do you have a desire to stop drinking?""   Also, perhaps wait until the end of the meeting and speak to this person one on one and have NA pamphlets on hand to give them?   

I've never been more angry over something, so I thought I'd get some feedback.   This is my sponsor's home group, not mine.   If it was my home group, I would definitely call a group conscience and address this.   Should I call this person out?   Not go to the meeting anymore?   Seems shitty to just let one person run the show like that in such a horrible way.",91,0

My life since then has gotten all the nice stuff back and a job and all and all things are going great.

That being said, things are moving so fast and I've gotten to the point where I'm incredibly stressed and overwhelmed. What didn't help was going back home for Thanksgiving. My hope was that, despite it not always being easy at home, I'd have a much needed break from work and have an opportunity to relax. I was a wreck. I worried myself sick about work, about this house I'm buying, and just about everything else. I was on edge. I even had an altercation with a couple of guys and now I'm worried about that too.

It's madness. It really is. Everything feels like it's falling apart. At one point I had the feeling that I NEEDED a drink. Not wanted - but actually needed it. I did not drink and got through it, but this isn't healthy.

I just feel like when I'm involved in the program I do better. It's pretty much me on my own trying to do my best without the program. With the program, I feel like I have this padding of purpose and enough of a different perspective that it helps me lead a better more positive life. Like going home - I wish I had had that then. I'm grateful for my good friends who I have met through the program. I was able to contact them some, but it sucks that I really hadn't been in touch with them much, and here I am running back to them when I'm a mess.

In any case, I just wanted to write that. I need/want to go back. I feel like this survival yet again, which is a terrible feeling. Thanks.

Edit: Thank you everyone for responding. I love the mix of wisdom and it's nice knowing other people are in a similar situation. I guess if my ass just got to a meeting, I'd have this kind of camaraderie there too. I'm going to go back. Thank you.",36,0

95,Sponsors and the benefit of time,25,e7eefs,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/e7eefs/sponsors_and_the_benefit_of_time/,4,1575725969.0,"Hi everybody, grateful to have something positive to share today: I've hit a tough spot in life, largely made tougher with traveling for the holidays, and my sponsor has been an invaluable support simply because he's ""been there, done that"" in sobriety so he can give me suggestions from his own experience, not a general or untested idea. Example: my wife wants me to cut down on my time outside the house because she needs more help with our two kids (baby and toddler age). I was all bent out of shape because I couldn't see how to make my weekly meetings and also be home more so I did some ranting and raving at my sponsor, who listened and at the end said, ""You know a lot of guys have had meetings in their own homes, especially if they have to babysit their kids.""

Blew my mind. Such a simple solution, but I never would have thought of it because every meeting I've ever been to has been out in some shared public space. So my stress and resentment immediately disappeared, we tapped a few guys in the group to ask for help, and we're hashing out a schedule to make this happen.

Just another example of how the program works and how surrounding myself with sober, clear-headed, and unselfish (usually) people has helped me.

Good luck out there, IWNDWYT",25,0

The treatment center I attended back in June-September, sends out quotes and readings everyday.

When I was drinking and using, no one ever asked my why I wasnt using oxycontin, or why I didnt want to do cocaine that day. But since I've been sober, ive been asked many times why I choose not to drink anymore. Thanksgiving being one of them I hadn't seen that side of the family since I got sober, first thing after I walked in the door, ""so do you want a shot, beer or mixed drink?"" I politely declined. After all the kids left, the questions started. ""Did you get a dui?"", ""so are you an addict?"" I tried to politely say that I didn't drink anymore, one family member asked if that meant forever. I choose not to drink today, and do so a day at a time. I dont know what will happen in 10, 15, 20 years down the line. I do know I enjoy sobriety,  life is good, my program works and I couldn't be happier.

I got sober in treatment and have been going to meetings daily since I got home 3~ weeks ago. 

I have a home group that I really love and its proximity to my house is perfect too. 

My problem now is the number of guys in all my groups that are hitting on me after meetings, sitting next to me, being flirty, or trying to edge their way into my life outside of meetings. 


I was naive in the beginning and gave my number to everyone - including men -  who seemed keen to support me through early recovery. 

Little did I know that after the first few supportive texts they‚Äôd start asking me personal questions, giving me compliments and asking me out etc. 

I feel awkward telling them to back off because a bunch of them are in my home group and I don‚Äôt want it to be weird. I‚Äôve told a couple of them I‚Äôm not interested in seeing anyone right now and they said they understood but now they‚Äôre just pursuing me in more subtle ways. 

There‚Äôs no womens‚Äô groups that are near me/fit my schedule. And honestly, I don‚Äôt want to be a pussy and leave this home group because of this problem because I‚Äôm 100% certain that it‚Äôs going to happen wherever I go. 

I don‚Äôt want anyone or anything  - especially random dudes - derailing my focus on working the program. 

I would be grateful to anyone who can teach me how to turn them down without it being weird and without compromising the overall health of the group. It doesn‚Äôt feel right that there‚Äôs all these unspoken dynamics floating around. Feels dishonest and icky. 

It‚Äôs a delicate situation and I‚Äôm very ill-equipped to handle it as I struggled with these same issues while I was in active addiction. 

Thanks to anyone who read this :)

Tips?,25,e82bt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/e82bt5/first_meeting_tomorrow_tips/,33,1575852344.0,I have struggled with alcohol addiction since I was 16 years old. I am currently 33F and I‚Äôm sick and tired of being sick and tired. My husband doesn‚Äôt mind when I drink but he doesn‚Äôt. We separate and go to different rooms and he plays music while I get drunk and watch tv and play on my phone. I thought I had the flu a few weeks ago. Researching more I realized I was having withdrawals. I let my husband think it was the flu. I stayed sober for a few weeks and then the holidays came around and I was feeling blue. My husband thought it cause I missed drinking and it was ok to treat myself. That turned into drinking for 2 weeks straight. I stopped on Saturday and started having withdrawal again. I came clean with my husband and told him I need help. He asked a friend who did AA if it helped and she said it did. I‚Äôm going to a meeting tomorrow after work. I‚Äôm very very nervous. I want to do this. I feel like I‚Äôve been just waiting for someone to ask me if I need help. Instead I just ended up asking before it gets worse. I‚Äôm trying to stay positive and focused.

Approximately a year and a half ago, I was in the darkest place I‚Äôve ever been. I felt like my entire life was crashing and burning all around me: marriage problems, family problems, friend problems, money problems, you name it. My depression and anxiety were out of control. Alcohol and drugs were the only thing I had to look forward to anymore and truly were my only friend and comfort. That had been my go-to solution the majority of my life. 

My greatest wish was that I just wouldn‚Äôt wake up in the morning. The suicidal thoughts were constant. The only true happiness and serenity I felt was when I made the decision to end my life. I finally felt relief that it would all be over soon. I still keep my suicide note as a reminder of my insanity. 

I kept drinking for a few months longer, more than ever before. Life got even darker and more sad and hopeless.  I had no friends left. It was painfully lonely. I was so depressed that it physically hurt. I‚Äôd go days without showering, eating, or leaving the house. It was truly pitiful. 

In my darkest time, I played Pok√©mon Go. It gave me a purpose in some kind of weird way. I ended up crossing paths with the school counselor from when I was in middle school. She also plays the game. She was the first person to suggest that maybe my drinking was a problem. Her husband is also one of us. Dude basically 12 stepped me, and he was the first person that I truly looked at and thought ‚ÄúI want what he has.‚Äù 

They took me to my first meeting. It took a few times for me to warm up to it, but the first time I said out loud that I‚Äôm an alcoholic, I just cried. I felt relief that maybe now that I knew what was wrong with me, I could find answers. In the coming weeks, I finally felt like I was where I belonged. 

I got a sponsor. I started working the steps, and I felt hope for the first time in a long time. Unraveling all my resentments, cleaning up my wreckage, making amends... it has been incredibly freeing. 

I could not have accomplished a year sober alone. I‚Äôve made so many friends in the rooms who have helped me get here. This has been a year full of lots of ups and downs, and things are still not perfect, but you folks have given me the tools to get through anything. I feel like at 29,  I am finally learning how to be an adult. I can have healthy relationships. 
I feel okay in my own skin for the first time. I am learning that being myself is awesome and cool. I don‚Äôt need to drink to feel better about myself or escape from life. I can be useful to others. I feel like life has meaning and purpose. I can be honest and trustworthy. 

What stands out the most is having friends. People I care about and who care about me, and who love me despite all the shitty things I‚Äôve done.  My relationships are much more honest and authentic.

I decided to show up here to explain to you how valuable you are to people in your life. When I was 9, I knew that something was wrong with my mother. I was not able to put words to it but I knew that she was different to other parents. By the time I was 13, my mother's drinking had reached the point where I was afraid whenever she drank. My mother would frequently tell me how much she hated me when she was drunk, how much she regretted I was born. When she was sober she would shower me with love but we could never talk about the bad moments. She became obsessed with people she thought had something against her, to the point where she would get restraining orders because she called them so much. 

Social services gave me a place to stay and by 19, my mother (44 y/o) and I started rebuilding our relationship. We had dinners together twice a week where we cooked. She would always drink water and we used to snuggle on the sofa and talk about life. I felt like I finally got my mother back. That was the time she first admitted that she had a problem. She would still drink sometimes when I wasn't around but she respected that I didn't want her to drink when I was around. She started talking about how she wanted her funeral whenever that would happen. She insisted that it was just to make sure I knew what she wanted for when she became older. That day she gave me a key to her flat and I felt like I had a part in her life, a key to a home. 

Later the same month, I had to have surgery and was unable to walk on my own when my mothers boyfriend (also alcoholic) called me and said he was worried about my mother and wanted me to go and make sure she was okay. I called my uncle and asked him to help me as I needed someone to hold to get around. He insisted that he would go alone as I was just released from hospital. I didn't like the idea as I was worried she would feel betrayed if I let her brother use the key to her flat. About 30 minutes later I got the phone call that would change my life forever, my mother had ended her life. 

This is 9 years ago tomorrow, which is why I am here. My heart was crushed to a million pieces that day and I don't think it will ever heal fully. I understand that when you are addicted it might seem like the world is better off without you but that is simply not true. I love my mother regardless of all the things that happened in the past. I forgive my mother for all the horrible things she has said and done and I wish that I could have told her that. It has taken me many years to get to the point where I am living without crying about losing her every day. I am not sure if I will ever really get over the pain but I don't want our story to end there. It doesn't matter if you are not able to do all the things you want to do for your loved ones this Christmas, our only wish is for you to live and get a second chance at life.

I work and live in Nd 7 months out of the year. My wife works and lives in Az. We own a home in both states. I left Fri night to head to Az feeling really good about myself and thinking about how my wife and I's relationship would be better. So I remember in late Nov when I was still up north I ask my wife if there was anything in particular that she would like for Christmas. She rattled a cpl things off and one thing she really wanted was a light fixture for our patio. It's a Mexican fixture made out of tin and they are quite nice. She said her girlfriend has one and she'd like one too. So this morning while she was doing some office work I set out to get my oil changed then went to the home improvement stores to look for such lamps. Nothing. So I txt her girlfriend and ask her where she purchased the lamp. She txt me back the website. I txt her back and said thanks. She txt me saying if I ordered it today I should get it by Christmas. I txt her back and said I gonna order it today. Then I ask her if her and her fiancee would have time for a get together. Sh txt me back yes. That was the end of it. I got home order the fixture the txt her girlfriend friend that I had ordered it. She txt me back cool. That was the end of it and I'm feeling really good about myself that I got what my wife wanted and she'll be really happy with it.

So I thought. My wife has this thing where she likes to snoop on me and what I'm doing. She can somehow get on to our phone service provider and see who I'm texting or calling and when I'm doing it. Btw that pisses me off to no extent. So tonight were sitting in the livingroom and all of a sudden she ask why her girlfriend was texting me so much. I told her that I texted her first about the Christmas present. Well wtf do you know, she just blew up. Accusing her friend and I of having some kinda secret affair. This couldn't be further from the truth. There was no reasoning with her at this point and I blew up. It turned into a shouting match. I decided I  needed to get out of there so I got dressed and told I was going to go fucking drunk. Believe me the freaking demon was knocking on the door. I  got in my truck and drove off thinking of hitting the nearest place to get beer but as I was driving a realization came to me. This is a test and I can't fail. I drove around for a bit then ended up here in a Walmart parking lot. I will not drink and no situation will ever make me.

Today marks one week since my last drink and I'm angry. I've been emerging myself in AA because I *know* that those around me who are able to maintain sobriety were only able to do so through AA, and they were successful in the program solely because they embraced a higher power. I know I have to find something/someone to have faith in which is pissing me off because I just can't wrap my mind around the idea of faith/higher power.

I am a control freak, I believe everyone has full autonomy and will to control their lives. No higher power is in control or is protecting us. I'll give the classic example that fuels my resentment of the higher power/god idea: war, poverty, suffering, hunger, abuse, greed, and overall evil. I was raised in a non-believing environment; no holidays, not even birthday celebrations, and no praying. Just logic and reason. When I was younger, I sometimes went to church/temple with friends after a sleepover. It drove me fucking insane, made me completely angry that people were using god as a scapegoat for their problems and also using it as a solution. I believe in science, all forms of therapy, philosophy, and even fucking yoga. Things with tangible reason/theory behind them, things I can use to personally better myself. And from experiencing/witnessing alcoholism and mental illness, I *do* believe nature and nurture form people. I don't think a creator just designed a flawed system, that seems counterproductive.

I am *really* fucking trying to believe and give in, it sounds freeing and healing and I want that for myself. But I can't stop thinking that I am fully responsible and accountable for myself, that I have to be the one to work for and through sobriety.

I'm not sure if this post has a point. I'm just extremely frustrated and when I try to express this at step or discussion meetings no one seems to fully understand, they always had access to faith and they never experienced my doubt. Which only perpetuates feelings of isolation and frustration for me because it takes a lot for me to silence my ego and ask for help.

""More than most people, I think, alcoholics want to know who they are, what this life is about, whether they have a divine origin and an appointed destiny, and whether there is a system of cosmic justice and love.

It is the experience of many of us in the early stages of drinking to feel that we have had glimpses of the Absolute and a heightened feeling of identification with the cosmos.  While these glimpses and feelings doubtless have a validity, they are deformed and finally swept away in the chemical, spiritual, and emotional damage wrought by the alcohol itself.

I couldn't eat and couldn't bring myself to shower or sleep. I truly felt like I was losing my mind and on some level I really was.

I didn't drink, but I could not bring myself to do anything to help me be healthy sober. I guess you could say it was ""dry alcoholism?"".

Vision is, I think the ability to make good estimates, both for the immediate and for the more distant future.  Some might feel this sort of striving to be heresy against ""One day at a time.""

But that valuable principle really refers to our mental and emotional lives and means chiefly that we are not foolishly to repine over the past nor wishfully to daydream about the future.  As individuals and as a fellowship, we shall surely suffer if we cast the whole job of planning for tomorrow onto a fatuous idea of providence.

God's real providence has endowed us human beings with a considerable capability for foresight, and He evidently expects us to use it.  Of course, we shall often miscalculate the future in whole or in part, but that is better than to refuse to think at all.

The unfortunate thing is that it has been hard to get to a meeting. Between just family events and fear of missing out, I've not hit a meeting in this city like I usually do. So I've been trying to get back to basics with the little things, finding ways to be of service. Making sure I stay up with my prayer. But that much has been a struggle. Its easy to take things for granted when I get comfortable and I'm very much looking forward to getting back to my home group. 

I got a text from a member of one of the groups I attend regularly yesterday and that was nice. Its really nice to have community. 

I'm so grateful to this program because even though this year I've been surrounded by alcohol constantly, I can stay humble, and of service, and focus on what I can put into the stream of life rather than take away from it. Its nice to get thank yous from family members for being helpful with dishes and cleaning up after 16 people. Its nice to be of service. It is so much better than the selfish slob I used to be, hiding out away from any responsibility, getting as drunk as I can on someone else's booze.

But there was none of that old behavior.  It was just genuine laughter, friendship, and love with my family. This really was the best holiday season I've had in a long time.

I had made the post trying to figure out if I should or shouldn't go through with this ""relationship"" that a guy in my home group wanted to start. The general consensus is that it did not sound like traditional 13th stepping, I also felt like he was being sincere. 

&#x200B;

We were all wrong. Very, very wrong. I'm also in my mid twenties and am pretty fresh out of a divorce so I haven't dated much and, thus, lack a lot of experience when it comes to spotting red flags and actually listening to my gut. 

&#x200B;

I've known this guy for about 4 months. I'm going through a lot of alcohol related legal trouble and he's been a great support person this whole time. About a month ago we went to the movies. I thought as just friends and it ended with a kiss. After that we went on probably a dozen or so dates. He wanted to meet my family, wanted me to meet his family, etc. 

&#x200B;

I was a little put off as to how much he was pushing for sex before we were even together (he said he wanted to take things slow as far as moving forward to a relationship but definitely didn't seem to want to take things slow when it came to getting physical. That should have been a red flag). So after spending almost every day together, frequently turning down advances for sex, etc. I finally gave in on Friday night when he came over to watch a movie. I told him ""I really would rather wait, I don't want this to change anything between us"" and he told me ""if anything, it will just make us closer"". 

&#x200B;

Like a FUCKING IDIOT, I gave in. 

&#x200B;

What do I get 36 hours later? A text, telling me he needs to make an amends for having sex with me. I was very confused about what he was talking about, and he told me that he didn't see a relationship going anywhere and wanted to just be friends and that he was sorry he lied to me about it. 

&#x200B;

I guess if anything, I learned my lesson. I didn't need another reason to not trust people but he definitely gave me one. I'm angry at myself for not having more of a guard up, I'm angry at myself for not sticking to my boundaries. 

&#x200B;

I'm angry at him because this is apparently a pattern with him and I'm angry that he is preying on other young women in the program. I talked with another younger girl in my homegroup about what happened and apparently he is a habitual 13th stepper and ""gets em while they're still shaking"". He tried the same thing with her and a handful of other young girls in the program apparently. 

&#x200B;

I talked to my sponsor and told her I didn't want to go back to my homegroup anymore and she told me ""absolutely not, that man is a predator. The only thing you did wrong was not listen to your intuition and you trusted the wrong person. You keep going and warn every young girl in that group of what he does and he can find a new homegroup if it makes him uncomfortable that his predatory behaviour is being exposed"". So I'm not leaving my homegroup, and I'm going in with confidence and just focusing on the real reason I'm there and that is to try and stay sober for another day! 

&#x200B;

I am at least happy that I learned a lesson from this and that's to not date within the first year. Really wish I had listened to that advice.",61,0

The year kicked off and I was seemingly holding it together, but in reality my mental health was falling apart. Then it happened. I was sexually assaulted.

At that moment in April, my life could‚Äôve taken a horrific turn. But instead of being eaten alive, I rose up from the ashes and have been reborn. The universe had better plans for me, and I thank my higher power for that. 

Sobriety isn‚Äôt easy. It has been gutting, emotional, and challenging. Towards the end of 2019, I began to slack in my program.

1. I drank alcoholically for 30 years,
2. I am just about the least disciplined person I know,
3. I was a spiritual neophyte,
4. I consider myself to be very independent,
5. I am a painful introvert avoiding groups,
6. I dislike being told what to do or following directions,
7. I would rather learn from my own mistakes than from others' experience,
8. I had multiple co-occuring addictions, 
9. I suffered from anxiety and depression, and
10. I am spoiled and want to get my own way, right now (impatient).

Despite these impediments to recovery, how is it possible that I received longer-term sobriety?  Alcohol beat me into submission (3 DUI's, divorce, health consequences, etc.) and I became desperate enough to want and seek help.  I simply had to stop drinking because the consequences of my drinking had become too painful for me to bare.  I begrudgingly went to AA, followed directions I didn't like, and haven't had to drink or drug since January 3, 2004.  

Early sobriety was an emotional roller coaster as my body and mind healed.  My mental obsession with drinking was removed once I completed the Steps during my first year of recovery and I haven't had a troubling thought about drinking in the 15 years since.

I didn't really believe that, probably throughout my entire duration of sobriety (almost a year). This sounds crazy, but the easiest part for me has been not drinking. Dealing with the WHY's and HOW's of how I got to this point of alcoholism, is the hardest. And the most uncomfortable. Last night, I took a hard look at my life the past 12 or so years (I just turned 30): flunked out of college because my priority was drinking and partying, friendships lost because they moved to other phases of their lives that didn't involve getting plastered regularly, shitty relationships because I attracted the wrong kind of person (because I was the wrong kind of person). My life revolved around drinking. It's hardest for me to accept this, because to some my life looks great. Traveling, good job, stable, reliable. But the alcohol was always my buffer; my savior, my best friend. It could shut my mind off and take my fears away. I guess my moment of clarity, was looking at a Facebook picture of an old college acquaintance and she was sitting at a table with a large margarita in front of her. And a plate of food. I thought to myself: that could never be me. I could never have that be my night. One margarita? Maybe, but only because of the expense. But on the way home, I'm getting a bottle. I'm getting drunk. I am begging others to get drunk with me, even if they don't want to. Even if they have work the next day and priorities and house cleaning and dinner making. Does anyone have coke? Yeah? Lets do that, too. Lets black-out. Lets detach from reality; it will bring us closer. It's that wild energy that I get as soon as I get that first sip, I get that wild energy and that's my downfall. 

I feel like I have finally come to terms with the fact that I have lost everything; not to the naked eye, but in my heart I know every failure in my life could be tied to alcohol. To my self-destructive impulses. I lost so many friendships that were important to me because I just couldn't settle down. I couldn't be a normal person. I know this is all over the place, but does anyone understand? Has anyone felt this way?

I attended a meeting I regularly attend today, and was joyed to find out that we were reading from ‚ÄúA Doctor‚Äôs Opinion‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt get the opportunity to share in the meeting, so I thought this would be an appropriate place to share my thoughts. 

This is my favorite chapter in the book, as it is the chapter that convinced me that AA and all it offers was for me. It allowed me to recognize that though my story doesn‚Äôt include losing absolutely everything prior to recovery, I am an alcoholic simply because I suffer the phenomenon of craving. I previously had an air of superiority that allowed me to believe that because I never drank in the morning, because I had never been to jail, because I had never had a DWI, because I had never faced tangible consequences while drinking and using, that I wasn‚Äôt truly an alcoholic. I was a skeptic in every sense, thinking I was the exception to the rule. This chapter proved me wrong, and I am so grateful it did.

This program has blessed my life beyond measure, and my gratitude is overwhelming. Currently, my grandmother is battling cancer, and it is indescribable how painful it is to watch someone you love face their own mortality. Yesterday, however, I was blessed with an opportunity that highlighted the gifts this program has brought into my life. My mother trusted me enough to ask me to bring my grandmother to an appointment to have her head shaved and get her wig styled, as her hair has begun falling out due to chemotherapy. She is currently very sick, and while it was difficult to bear witness to, I found myself shocked that I sat with her during the process and I prayed for her. Had someone told me nine months ago that I would be using prayer (and not alcohol and various substances) to cope in difficult times, I would have told them they were absolutely insane. You see, my Higher Power is not the God I was introduced to in my childhood, as religion and prayer often had a negative connotation for me based on being a queer woman who was ‚Äúimpure‚Äù at a young age due to molestation. I never felt at home in the church I was raised in, and frankly the ‚ÄúGod‚Äù word scared me. Thanks to this program, I have been able to gain an understanding of what spirituality looks like for me, and I pray constantly now. It brings me serenity and quiets my mind. Simply being trusted to show up for my family and do something so important for someone I love so dearly is a gift of this program. Finding myself praying throughout the process is a gift of this program. Coping with this difficult situation without being inebriated is a gift of this program. Among the many other gifts I have been blessed with in my recovery, today I recognize the gravity of these gifts.

Though I certainly came to scoff, I am so grateful I have remained to pray.",17,0

I feel like this is super fucked up. I mean if the ONLY sober time you have is because of jail and you go and get blitzed the day you get out, that's one thing. But if you keep your sobriety going forward I don't see why the time in jail ""doesn't count"".

I had checked myself in the day before, but with a BAC of .39 they had to send me to the hospital. That was a dark time for me. I had been to rehab the previous summer and thought it ‚Äúworked,‚Äù but I was back out in no time. The holidays had been one long bender where I was downing ~1/2 gallon of Nikolai a day. If I‚Äôm being honest, I only went to rehab because I lost my bank card and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get more booze. Knowing that DTs were imminent, I reluctantly asked my mom for help (call the rehab as well as get me a bottle in the meantime). 

That rehab wasn‚Äôt the best, there were drugs and sex and people only there to avoid prison or get in out of the cold. But the one thing they did for me - that ended up completely changing my life - was hammering into my head that I needed to get to an A.A. meeting, put my hand up and ask for help. So, roughly one month later, I went to a meeting and did one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done. I raised my hand and said I was new, I was scared and I needed help. Life hasn‚Äôt been the same since. In the following months I got a sponsor, got a home group, got commitments, worked steps and tried to help other alcoholics any way I could. 

Things have changed so much in the past year. I‚Äôm no longer ashamed of the man I am. I think of others before myself. I try to be helpful and of service in all aspects of my life. I have a relationship with my higher power that I never dreamed possible (I was previously an atheist). I try my best to be better every day. No matter what I don‚Äôt take a drink, but that sobriety is completely reliant upon the maintenance of my spiritual condition. 

If you‚Äôre new to A.A., believe me, you‚Äôre in the right place. Take a chance, swallow your pride and ask for help. Be honest about your problem and someone with reach their hand out and help you. You will begin a journey beyond your wildest dreams. All you have to do is ask.",81,0

It's weird to be able to narrow-down a date where you ""become"" something like an alcoholic. But, 8 years ago today is when my life changed in such a radically drastic way that it changed me completely. It made me someone I hated. It made me someone that I was afraid of and afraid for. 

8 years ago, I was engaged. I was with someone who was the answer to all my prayers. I had the best friends imaginable, I had just bought my first vehicle. The vehicle thing was a major, major accomplishment for me. I felt a sense of freedom and independence that I had never, ever felt in my entire life. I was so blissfully happy. Finally! After dealing with deep depression my entire life, eating-disorders, a childhood of abuse. Finally. I was happy! 22, my whole life was ahead of me and I was thrilled.

8 years ago today, that all came crashing down. My fiance left me. He sat me down and told me he'd been sleeping with who I thought was my best friend. I was gutted...devastated. I felt like I was watching my life shatter before my very eyes and in a lot of ways, I was. After my fiance came clean about the affair, he took his things and left.

Later on in the evening, a very good friend of mine was having  a surprise party thrown for her. Her boyfriend begged me to come, I didn't want to, but came anyways. I left before my friend showed up, pretty much sneaking out the back door. Not surprisingly, her and I were never close after that. How selfish could I have been? This friend in question was someone that was so, so, so important to me. The fact that our friendship disintegrated into nothingness during this time period is probably my greatest regret. 

I went off the deep end. It is the first time in my life I drank because I was running away from feelings. Before, I was just a party girl. I just liked to have fun. Now, I was a wreck. Good friends stopped wanting to spend time with me, because I was a mess. I drank to black out because I was so miserable. I threw myself at any guy who would even look at me twice because I was so desperately sad that the person I gave everything to could do what he did to me. Things in my life were very, very black. I totaled my beloved car one evening (I wasn't drunk driving).

In the years that followed, I went further and further down the hole. I dated drug users, dealers, alcoholics, cheaters. I drank and drank and drank and drank. I lost jobs, lost friends. While I was over my ex by the time I moved on to other men, I was never able to rid myself of that worthless feeling. That feeling of complete and absolute failure that I felt when my fiance left me. 

What saddens me the most about my alcoholism, is how many people it pulled me away from. Very good friends stopped inviting me out, stopped wanting to talk to me or spend time with me. I felt like such a failure and acted like such a failure. I became so deeply depressed for so many years. 

Now, 8 years after that initial chaos, I am just now healing from the self-imposed chaos I put myself through. I have so much regret for how I treated so many people I loved. What advantage I took of people. But I am trying to move on.

I got back from a motorcycle ride today. Unfortunately the roads are still soaked in new England, which made for a tricky ride. I was hoping for some dry weather, but oh well.

I drove the bike off the lot with zero miles last october, and got almost 1200 miles on it since. Every time I ride it, I think back to laying in my bunk in state prison, flipping through over a hundred volumes of American Iron. I wanted a harley sportster, but then i fell in love with the ktm duke. And last october i got the bike i started dreaming of 5 years ago in prison.

But before prison was another prison. My isolated drinking, my self incarceration. It w as s worse than real prison, if you could imagine such a thing. Well, if you're reading this than maybe you have a clue. I wasnt desperate, I wasnt in denial. I was defeated. I honestly believed I wouldn't die drinking, I would just live in misery forever. And the excuses to not get sober. They were plentiful and absurd. Any rational person would have laughed in my face upon hearing the nonsense. The mind is a terrible thing.

So I did not get sober on my own, it took me being an absolute scumbag and being locked up for 4 years and 3 months before I committed to sobriety. Even in prison that's tough, home brew is everywhere as well as psych meds and some other stuff. Us cons always find a way. But I held my line, worked the steps, fixed what I could, and forgave myself and others for the rest. planned for a better life.

And here it is. After I got off the bike after a terrible, slow, slippery ride, I just smirked.

 If that's the worse part of my day, I think I'm going ok.

243,I went to my first meeting in over a year tonight. I wasn't expecting this level of peace.,52,eoi7pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/eoi7pa/i_went_to_my_first_meeting_in_over_a_year_tonight/,18,1578987804.0,"*insert bullshit excuses of why I haven't been going here*

Yesterday, I was at a funeral and talking to a family friend who cannot stay sober. I'm listening to him asking me for help (I have 9yrs in February if all goes well) just thinking to myself I ethically cannot offer him help since I'm dry as FUCK. I gave him some numbers but it bothered me. A lot.

Then tonight I'm packing up my house and an old friend invites me to a meeting and it felt like the stars aligned. For the first time in a year, I didn't think about work for an hour. I didn't think about family drama, work drama, or feel at all like the vibrating ball of anxiety I've been. For the first time in a year I had intelligent conversation. For the first time in a year I felt understood. I forgot how magical meetings are and that this is how my higher power works in my life.

I was really scared to go back. I was worried I would be berated (which I was by one guy, but my friend stepped in quickly*). I was worried I would be the ""newcomer again"". I was so worried about what everyone else would say and the sheer effort to leave the house was even difficult, however I'm glad I went. I feel peaceful and relaxed and stable again. I'm back, baby, and ready to help myself and others again.


*I want to mention something. I was confronted rather aggressively after the meeting about why I didn't speak, why I haven't been going to meetings, why this why that and how my clean time means nothing now because I am dry and how I ""need to decide if I'm going to kill myself or drink again"". He was treating me like I was less than him. My first thought was ""wow this was a big fucking mistake. I'm never coming back now."" And I remembered why I stopped coming to meetings. My friend shooed him away and other people did damage control (hi higher power, I see you). But I've seen this as a pattern in the 9 years I've been sober (8 going to meetings) dont beat people up for fucking up. We're flawed. Stop telling people how to work their program. I hate this hollier than thou attitude some of the old timers have. No one is better than anyone in meetings. When it comes down to it, we're just a bunch of drunks trying to survive and thrive.

249,7 years today,82,eoxnhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/eoxnhb/7_years_today/,20,1579063876.0,"Seven years ago today, on January 14, 2013, I woke up. I‚Äôd had my last drink at midnight the night before. It was unceremonious, namely because I couldn‚Äôt really get a good dunk going anymore. I watched Tina and Amy host the Golden Globes, finished my drink and went to bed. 

My (half-hearted) plan was to try the whole AA thing, fuck it up and go back to drinking, uttering a feeble ‚ÄúWell I tried and it didn‚Äôt work‚Äù just so I could cross it off my list. Because that‚Äôs what I do: I fail. I fuck up. I don‚Äôt follow through. I make promises to myself I don‚Äôt keep - can‚Äôt keep, sometimes even for an hour or two. And I knew there was no way in hell I was going to be able to not pick up a drink for 24 hours. Every day for 9 years, I‚Äôd guzzled vodka like it was my job. My body needed it. I couldn‚Äôt imagine life without it. 

Because I already knew my foray into AA was going to be a fluke, I told no one about my plan. I lived alone, no partner, no kids. I didn‚Äôt tell my parents or friends. I was going to go and fail alone and no one would be the wiser.  

And if I‚Äôm being honest, if left to my own advances, I 100% would have screwed it up. I mean, I never bothered to try to quit drinking or even slow down because I knew I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt even try to kid myself that I could. 

The most unlikely fucking thing in the world happened that January day. It is, far and away, the most dumbfounding, unexpected experience of my life. And I have not had a drink since that day. 

Because I was bereft. I would have sworn that I didn‚Äôt have an ounce of self-preservation left. I didn‚Äôt think I could cough up a single fuck to give about self or my well-being. 

I‚Äôm convinced, though, the reason it worked is because I had nothing to do with it. My legs carried my body into the meeting and that‚Äôs about it. You can think of your higher power as what/whomever you want; for me my higher power is God. And God saved my ass that day. 

He surrounded me with a bunch of other (former) sad-sack drunks who started talking and telling their stories, which were my stories. All the sick little secrets I had, they said aloud. 

One thing some of them seemed to have that I didn‚Äôt was peace. I‚Äôd never had it, but damn if I hadn‚Äôt chased it my whole life in some form or other: relationships, money, things, food, booze. These people had it. And I wanted it. And they told me if I wanted it I could have it if I did a dozen or so things in a particular order. It‚Äôs probably to my benefit that I take instruction well. Lol 

For anyone new, or who keeps relapsing, I will just say this. If you‚Äôve walked into an AA meeting and gotten even a glimpse of what life on the other side of alcohol could look like‚Äî then you‚Äôre a miracle. You already got further than 90% of  alcoholics. For every person who walks in those rooms, there are 100‚Äìhell, 1000‚Äìwho don‚Äôt. Won‚Äôt. Never will. 

The people in those rooms will help save your life. If hearing the voice of God sounds far-fetched, then consider that God will simply speak through every person there. You‚Äôll hear again and again what you need to hear. 

Some days you, like me, might barely stay sober. You might have the glass to your lips...and inexplicably set it down. Some days you‚Äôll be a grumpy bitch. Some days you‚Äôll swear you‚Äôd punch a baby for a stiff drink. But the longer you stay sober, the fewer those days become. And in the meantime you learn how to navigate those situations in real ways. No bullshit. That‚Äôs the good things about most AA rooms: there‚Äôs a shortage of bullshit and if you try slinging any, some grizzled old drunk‚Äôs gonna call you out. Which is a delight. 

I may or may not be sober this time next year; I hope I am. But today...I‚Äôm grateful to just be sober TODAY. 

I usually just lurk here, but I‚Äôm grateful for this community. Just reading all of your stories and words - whether you‚Äôve got 24 hours, just relapsed, or celebrated 25 years - gives me hope and helps me stay sober just one more day. I hope you all keep coming back.",82,0

Let me start by saying how grateful I am for AA and my sobriety. I‚Äôve always loved how I can say whatever I think and feel and I‚Äôm met with compassion and love, no matter how crazy I get. 

I have and continue to work a program. I have a sponsor. I‚Äôve done and continue to work the steps. I have sponsees, and one who actually calls me on a regular basis and does the work with me. I have a home group, a service commitments and most of my friends are in the program. 

I start my days with prayer and meditation. I try to eat healthy, I go to the gym. I see a therapist. 

I‚Äôm miserable. I find myself obsessed with death. My heart pounds out of my chest when I wake up and I feel terminally unique, even though I know I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm restless, irritable and discontent. I would rather die by suicide than drink or use again. I don‚Äôt want to feel the way I feel. 

I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who has made mistakes in sobriety. I want to be spiritual, I want to be happy, I want to get outside of myself and be useful to others. 

I‚Äôm at work today. I spend most of my working hours listening to AA podcasts or speaker tapes. I can always relate to the drunkologue portion of the story, but when they begin speaking of the happy joyous and free sober life I just can‚Äôt relate because it hasn‚Äôt been my experience.

I met a guy the other night who also has 10 years and he told me he hates himself and maybe there is this second level of surrender that needs to happen. Maybe so. I‚Äôm open to suggestions.

So I have an EXTREME fear of public speaking. Im one of those stories you hear about thinking of going back out just to avoid leading after your year sobriety. I walked out of my first lead with a severe panic attack and felt like i couldnt breathe. My sponsor made me go back up and finish it. 

Anyway, ive continued to lead for the past 3 years since my first lead (Sobriety date is 10.19.15) and I still cringe every single time im asked to lead. I dont say no because its what I was taught but the thought of leading and being constantly asked makes me not want to go to meetings anymore. Which i know is not the best idea. Ive found myself avoiding the people who hint toward asking me to lead instead of just telling people what's going on. My sponsor knows whats going on and she said it was okay to say no if I really didnt want to but I guess im kinda feeling like im not a part of AA or im taking an easy way out of what everyone else does to give back so I say yes anyway and then find myself having little resentments.

259,"Sometimes recovery from alcoholism requires working on the underlying issues that led to the drinking -- anxiety disorder, PTSD, depression -- including the alcohol addiction.

We can get sober, but if those issues remain unresolved, the likelihood of drinking again is a looming possibility. The first two steps is often the stopping point for newcomers at AA, and if they don't go further into the steps, it's likely they'll relapse, possibly many times.

Someone close to me has finally gone to a counselor and to a psychiatrist because they kept relapsing and really wanted to quit, but couldn't. AA alone wasn't enough. Turns out they had anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and PTSD from sexual trauma. Without treating those issues, quitting drinking becomes just a bandaid on a gaping, open wound. 

Now I see this person attending counseling as well as going to AA. The desire for alcohol has lessened more and more as they learn about themselves. There were huge issues from the past -- family dysfunction, etc. -- that needed examination and correction. Now that this person isn't drunk all the time, they can work on these issues with a sober, open mind. It's a win-win situation, because the addiction and the deeper issues feed off each other, and now that BOTH are being addressed, they are losing their power. Life is now wide open for improvement, instead of hidden in isolation.

There is hope. AA is crucial for support and educating oneself about the disease. The 12 steps and, if needed, further professional counseling, help alcoholics examine one's underlying faulty thinking and life events/patterns that encouraged -- and then enabled -- the drinking as a coping mechanism (which then became a problem in itself).

I'm writing this in admiration for my friend's daring and courageous work on difficult, painful issues, and in joyful relief that they are sober and under professional care. I see tremendous changes ahead.",82,0

The third tradition sais that the only requirement for comming to AA is the wish to stop drinking. 
Our oldtimers allways say when new guys come to AA and ask if they are right, that no one comes for fun to the AA. So if they need to think if they are AAs they are probably AAs.

Hello everyone. I'm looking into creating a Discord server for alcoholics who play video games. My goal is to have an easy way for people in recovery to meet up, game out, and stay connected. If this is something you would be interested in please let me know by either upvoting my post or placing a comment below! Please keep in mind that this would be my first time modding and running a Discord server so any help and tips are appreciated. Also I would love to have some help with the name. Some of the names I have so far are... Bill's Gamers, A.A.G., One Game At A Time, and Ex-Jaywalkers. Im open to feedback and would like to hear any opinions! Thanks.

EDIT: So.. ""To Be Fair..."" The most upvoted name will become the name!

Over time, a few of them started to mean something to me.  They could also mean something different, when applied to different situations.  Eventually, these sayings turned into ""tools"" that would pop into my head at times, and help keep my thinking grounded in the AA way.

There is non-traditional (I think) saying I heard from my sponsor that pops into my head when I find myself in situations where others are drinking or I see a bottle of liquor that gets my attention.  ""Once a cucumber turns into a pickle, it can never go back to being a cucumber.""  At some point in my past, I turned into a pickle.  I will never be a cucumber again, and I cannot drink like one.  The thought ""I'm a pickle"" will spontaneously pop into my head, and all thoughts of the alcohol around me tend to go away.

I also accept that tools like this will only continue to work for me if I keep myself grounded in the AA program.  I've seen enough people with way more years of sobriety than me stop going to meetings, and eventually go back out drinking.  As the ""cheesy"" saying goes, ""meeting-makers make it!""",11,0

I will try to make this story as short as possible but this subreddit just made me realize I HAVE to stop drinking because I‚Äôm almost positive I have acute pancreatitis but also because I read a lot of your stories and I realized I‚Äôm better and bigger than this life I am living. Fist off, I am not religious. I am highly spiritual but I do not relate myself to any religion. With that said, I don‚Äôt take offense to speaking about your beliefs but please don‚Äôt attempt to change mine. 

So my story..... I got a fake ID when I was 19. I started going out and drinking about 3-4 nights a week with older restaurant coworkers and started driving drunk pretty often. Shortly after turning 19, I moved out of my parents house due to issues with my father and moved in with my boyfriend. He was a heavy drinker, so was his sister and her boyfriend, and his mom was an alcoholic. They had a hard life and all they knew was drinking. My boyfriend rarely used shot glasses and so we‚Äôd just pour an amount in a cup and chase it. We did this almost every single night. Leading to arguments a lot. ........... fast forward to me being 21 and moving to a college beach town with nothing to do but drink. That‚Äôs all anyone did. I drank every single night, maybe took a break here and there when I was too hungover to drink.......... fast forward again to me being 22 and moving in with my NEW boyfriend (who I am still currently with, we have been together since I was 21, about 3 years). He is the most incredible human being I have ever met or come to know. I am so very lucky to have him and he loves me unconditionally and would never hurt me. Well he drinks too, we got worse with each other and it turned into an every single night thing because in the beginning we had so much fun when we drank........ fast forward again to now. I am an alcoholic. Ashamed of drinking, hide it, take 3-unknown numbers of shots per night. I have become a monster, done and said things I‚Äôd never do to my amazing boyfriend. He‚Äôs still around, no clue why, but I have to get a grip on this or we will never have a future and I will never have a healthy future with someone if I don‚Äôt stop.

 My first several months were very emotionally chaotic without booze and I unfortunately was not very honest with some Marijuana maintenance to keep myself from a drinking.

The 6 months that followed we pushed through the steps quickly and thoroughly.  I had a breakthrough with my mental health professionals. I became very involved in my home group, helped my fellow alcoholics any way I could to get outside of myself, eventually became selected for a small service position as intergroup rep, I chair once a week, and then amazing things started to happen and guys started asking me to be their sponsor (I now have 2 sponsee's).

My family life has improved including trust issues and intimacy  with my wife. Recently though, my youngest daughter (age 13) has started manipulating and lying the way I used to.  My wife is being pushed to her limit because I did this same thing to her for our entire marriage. (We have separated several times in the past because of it).

I talk to my daughter about the way lying will make you feel if you keep it up. But she has already started believing her own lies. Even when caught red-handed. I‚Äôm worried because that‚Äôs how I started out. And by age 14, I was already experimenting with drugs and alcohol as an escape from my feelings.

This program really works. First it helped me get sober and stay sober for about 14 months now, and now it's helping me learn how to love and be kind. I've been praying and meditating for kindness and patience, and today I felt a more natural intuition to show love and support to my a dear friend who continues to show up in our friendship, always with support, instead of my normal ""I don't have time for this"".

Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.  How many times have we heard well-intentioned people claim the guidance of God when it was plain that they were mistaken?  Lacking both practice and humility, they deluded themselves and were so able to justify the most arrant nonsense on the ground that this was what God had told them.

People of very high spiritual development almost always insist on checking with friends or spiritual advisers the guidance they feel they have received from God.  Surely, then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders.

While the comment or advice of others may not be infallible, it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance we may receive while we are still inexperienced in establishing contact with a Power greater than ourselves.

If we're going to stay sober, we've got to learn to want something else more than we want to drink.  When we first came into A.A., we couldn't imagine wanting any thing else so much or more than drinking.  So we had to stop drinking on faith, on faith that some day we really would want some thing else more than drinking.  But after we've been in A.A. for a while, we learn that a sober life can really be enjoyed.  We learn how nice it is to get along well with our family, how nice it is to do our work well whether at home or outside how nice it is to try to help others.  Have I found that when I keep sober, everything goes well for me?

Meditation

There is almost no work in life so hard as waiting.  And yet God wants me to wait.  All motion is easier than calm waiting, and yet I must wait until God shows me His will.  So many people have marred their work and hindered the growth of their spiritual lives by too much activity.  If I wait patiently, preparing myself always, I will be some day at the place where I would be.  And much toil and activity could not have accomplished the journey so soon.

Thoughts of ‚Äútrying a drink, just one‚Äù after the year anniversary keep coming up. I go to meetings almost every day. I have a budget and income to go with the budget. My husband and I are back together. Husband is a very heavy drinker and he would love it if I were to drink with him. If I want to spend time with him, its always in a brewpub. Craft beer is my favorite, so in these brew pubs, I smell it. 

And yes I know I can leave and go to a meeting. 

I have an excellent sponsor and we have worked the steps together. She says I will be able to sponsor other women if asked. 

Like I said, my life is a million times better sober. I get to do some responsibilities too now. I work at my Alono club coffee shop every week. I go to Intergroup meetings as a guest with my home group Intergroup rep. I go to my home groups every week plus lots of other meetings. 

So why is there these thoughts of drinking? Is this just normal and move on with my continued sober journery?",10,0

I've been incredibly busy with a new job and the process of listing a house for sale. This little dip in my program aside, its been probably the best year and a half of my life.

I went into treatment for the 2nd time after a 2 year relapse. I was miserable, bordering on suicidal at times and I physically could not stop drinking. I had had 6 years before that and getting back to long-term sobriety seemed impossible.

But, by the grace of God, here I am. When I left treatment, I went hard into AA and recovery. I realized that I had never really taken the steps or the program seriously in the past and I grew immensely. I was the guy that was so into it for a while that I though I wanted to be an addiction counselor. Although I've outgrown that urge, I have remained very involved in service work. I even sponsored someone for while. He's back out there, but thats just part of the game. 

One thing different for me is prioritization. Sobriety had to truly be #1. At this point, I will miss a meeting here and there, but never just because ""I dont feel like it."" I guess this time around, it was made clear to me that this is a fatal disease and I am capable of killing myself with alcohol. Whether thats wrapping my car around a pole, putting a gun in my mouth, or just grinding my liver to dust. It doesn't matter, thats where I'll go if I pick up another drink.

Another big thing is involvement. I'm a part of the AA community. I don't just sit in the back of the room and leave right after the meeting. I have friends in the program. I share meals with people in the program. I speak at detox centers and write letters to inmates. Whatever I can do to stay involved. I see a step away from involvement in AA as a step toward relapse.

I'd probably be dead or close to it without AA. I love this program and I owe my life to it. I can truly say I'm a grateful alcoholic. Because take away the booze and I'm still a selfish, lying, egomaniac. The depths of despair alcoholism brought me to have allowed me to embrace a way of life that is truly beautiful.

I‚Äôm working with a sponsor and have made it through step 3 and am currently working on step 4.

Every time I say that I am not going to attend a meeting for personal time or work reasons I always get a negative response from my sponsor about how I am hurting myself and that I am not taking this stuff seriously. This negativity has me not wanting to communicate effectively with him. I do under where he is coming from as I always get his story about how alcohol almost killed him because of the amount he was drinking but my experience with alcohol is much different than that. Am I being self centered in wanting a few nights a week to spend time with my family versus the 2 hours going to a meeting takes up?

I am 23, and was able to fully admit i was an alcoholic at 22 and walk in to a wonderful group near my home where i asked myself if my life had also become unmanageable, i answered yes. 

 January 1st 2019 i began my new journey to recovery, i made friends that cared and helped me, something that was alien to me.  I became a cancer survivor at 10yrs old, i went infront of judges at 15, and i contemplated suicide countless times. In the fellowship of AA i found out i wasnt alone in that. I found out i was not as unique as i once thought i was. Instinct told me i should be disappointed im not ""special"", but the opposite is true. I became relieved, surrounded by others that knew just what i had been through with a higher understanding then myself, an understanding im ultimatly grateful they share with me to this day. 

 I am a newcomer still. A little over a year sober, i have much to learn, but have also found a great home where i can learn safely. I was hopeless, one more drink will mean my doom. So i continue to go to AA today. Tonight i will pray that my higher power will give me the strength again to get up, go to work, and go to another meeting and get through another 24 hours. I will ask that every night, and hope that my persitence retains through as many 24 hours my life will have. 

  I see a lot of people on this reddit who are new to the program, i wish all of you the best of luck on this new chapter of your life. I also ask ,humbly, that old timers and others well into sobriety share your hope and experience with the newly sobered drunks here. Give us more stories to read so maybe when that newcomer gets on here to ask for help, they may be stopped by your story first and figure out what they can do next.

He's not a saint, she tells him. He's a human being with flaws, including a temper. But every day he prays, and swims laps in a pool, and writes letters ‚Äî a lot of letters  ‚Äî to his friends. And that, more than any innate quality, turns a guy from Pittsburgh named Fred into ""Mister Rogers.""

When I'm asked to qualify at AA meetings, I usually start by reciting my sobriety date (6/19/17) and by listing all the things I do every day to stay sober: prayer, meditation, going to meetings, reading spiritual literature, calling three alcoholics a day (not including my sponsor), and finding opportunities to be of service. I list these practices not to signal my virtue but to reinforce that to me, sobriety is a set of daily habits, not a state of being.

When I was young I felt deeply uncomfortable in my own skin and obsessed over what others thought of me. I had very little confidence or self-esteem. I lived in constant fear. When I discovered alcohol, at age 15, I felt relieved of the burden of self and, for a fleeting moment, happy, joyous, and free. Eventually, my drinking spiraled out of control until I finally quit at age 36. My physical recovery began immediately. But I was still left with the same character defects that had made me turn to alcohol in the first place.

I begin each day by praying for these defects to be removed. I know that they won't disappear completely ‚Äî that would be impossible. But the act of daily prayer and of opposite action *has* made me a different person. I still lose my temper on occasion, but my practice of prayer and opposite action has given me tools to mitigate the damage. I have the ability to think ""this is a situation in which I'd become impatient"" which, in turn, makes me less impatient. And when I do suffer from lapses, from unsober behavior, I am able to console myself by remembering that I've made vast improvements from the way I used to be. Progress, not perfection.

I've become the sort of person I had always loathed: scheduled, organized, fond of routine, and orderly. But it doesn't bother me much. This way has given me more joy than I ever had when I fancied myself a footloose bohemian. I still get to lead the life that I want to lead ‚Äî but not until I've prayed.",123,0

I am not sure if I belong here but it seems like a place where people will understand me. If I am breaking any rules then I am sorry and will be out.

Its just that I am not an alcoholic. I never drank for more than 3 days in a row and mostly didn't drink if I had to work next day and I have no trouble refusing if somebody offers me a drink now. I am more of a binge drinker who can't stop when started until I blackout. If alcohol is over before I blackout I feel a sort of desperation. So I drank like that  1-3 times a week for over a decade.

And then a few years ago I decided to stop. I am not even sure why anymore. Maybe because I fell on my face and broke two of my teeth on two different occasions in one year, because I am now with an actual alcoholic or because I was afraid I may say something or cheat on him by accident. Not sure. Only now I really hate life. It is all grey and depressing.Nothing got better like for example when it comes to work but everything else just got worse. I tried to find ways to have fun without drinking but I just can't. Its like if you ever felt true fun all the substitutes just don't live up to it. I also don't really know who I am anymore. I guess I identified myself too much with being a fun, wild drunk. I loved all the stories of what I did when drunk and actually enjoyed all the positive and negative things people were saying about me. Now I don't know where to put myself. I try to get my boyfriend to quit and that not just because I worry about him but because I feel jealous when I see him drunk. I hate his friends who come to drink with him because I imagine myself drinking with them. It hurts when I see my old friends now being his friends asking what happened with me. They all probably think I am a stuck up bitch who is against fun. And I can't find any new friends because I have no idea how to connect with people anymore (acquaintances yes, but no friends) . I did get drunk a couple of times in the past 3 years but only like 5 times per year and his friends all said they like me more that way which I get, I agree with them. I started getting high on opiates but this doesn't help as it isn't a very social drug.

Basically everything is absolutely awful and I don't know how to change it. I keep on telling myself that I will go back and plan to get a vodka bottle on Friday but something always stops me. I think mainly because of my parents who are so happy with the change in me because they can't see how miserable I am and I don't want to hurt them. Back in the days I didn't care about that, I only cared about what I wanted and I miss this too.

Anyways. I am sure people here felt this way and can maybe give some sort of advice? Did you ever find the same happiness without drinking, made any real friends, found a way to be happy with who you are etc.?",17,0

When I use the terms ""sober"" and ""sobriety' here, I mean absolutely no drinking even in moderation - complete abstinence.

To make a long story short, I had a drinking problem maybe 3-4 years ago where I occasionally used alcohol to self medicate and self harm. It was ineffective, making my life unmanageable, and thankfully I was able to stop using it in this way through mental health treatment (with a focus on impulses and BPD, not addiction). I was then raped in August at a bar with friends. My attacker was one of my friends, and honestly? He lead me into an alley that I would have gone into sober because I trusted him. But I decided after that to stop drinking because I told myself alcohol made me more vulnerable. 

I've since realized that while sobriety is only doing me well, I chose a shitty reason to start. My sponsor reached out to me, and I posed a question: does it matter whether or not I'm sober for the right reasons? And I told her my fear is that because I began sobriety following the rape, I'm sending myself a message that my drinking caused my rape and that it's my fault. That if this was my logic, sobriety is helpful for some issues but creates others. She sends me back, ""Right, it is your fault you were raped. Are there other ways in which alcohol was making your life unmanagable around that time?""

What the fuck. First off, she and I have a similar history with trauma. How does she not know better? Second, I know there's a culture in my local AA groups (and maybe all of AA) about personal responsibility, and you're responsible for what happens when you're drunk because you likely contributed to it. But for her to stick to that rhetoric in a situation where it certainly doesn't fit makes me feel like she's is blindly following. It scares me to think that my values could become so skewed by being in this program, and I wonder if I've already picked up on harmful ideas. I want to be sober and I want to be a better person, but I can't be a better person by victim blaming or doing other harmful crap.

One thing I will not do today is drink. I have to consider if my reasons for being sober matter, but right now my reason is dignity. I made a commitment and I'm sticking to it. Even if there's no reason to keep it, I haven't disowned it yet.

But what the fuck.",53,0

My friend found me in a filthy bathroom wrapped around one of the most disgusting toilets I ever saw. I didn't care, I was so fucking trashed the puke just kept flowing. Took me couple days to stop feeling like shit. My friend asked me to take him to an AA meeting. I was like sure dude. He asked me if I wanted to come in. I went in and it was the coldest most depressing place I'd ever been. While I listened I questioned if I was like them. Seeing these said addicts I reasoned I needed to cut back on the booze but I wasn't one of them. Off and on I drank after until one day I got sober, for 5 years. But I wasn't an alcoholic. Then in October last year I started drinking again. I spirialed wildly and made myself violently ill. I knew I needed help. I almost ruined my future and my life. My doctor sat me down and said if I touched a drink again I will die. Not maybe, not scare tactics, I will die. I was scared shitless. I turned to a friend told them what happened and they sent me to AA. I was scared I knew I had to do something but I didn't think AA was the answer.  When I stepped through those doors I was meet with happiness, welcome warmth, I got numbers, names, and hugs. The people took me to good meetings and now I have a family in my homegroup it's a blessing.

Just coming off my longest bender. 3-4 years of secret drinking, a pint or 1 and a half of vodka a day. Followed by, since about September 2019, an absolute disaster - 2 handles of cheap vodka every three days. No days missed.

Had to drive from Minnesota to New York for a funeral. At a motel on the way, I had a morning epiphany. I had been going on, and just expecting that I'd drink myself to death. And if the money ran out first, I'd just off myself.

But at that Super 8, I realized that I didn't want to die. No reason. I just decided that I didn't want that.

Reconciled with my boyfriend, who readily accepted me back, with obvious hard limits and conditions.

Been attending daily AA meetings for 5 days so far. 5 days sober isn't much for me, but *lately*, it *is* quite unusual.

Bear with me through my rambling, and help if you can.

My abusive ex has been stalking me ever since I left him about 2 years ago.  Last week, he made it clear that he's found my new address (I moved into my new house in September), and he will make me talk to him.   This immediately triggered me, because drinking was the way I hid all the pain and fear when I was with him.  All the fear came flooding back.   And did all the intense cravings to drink.

I attempted to get a protective order against him, because his actions are a threat and I fear for my imminent safety.  The judge denied this, saying there wasn't an explicit threat.  This then sent me deeper into a spiral of despair, because there's nothing else I can do in this situation for myself.  I feel so defeated because I tried to stand up for myself and failed.  

I've gone to several meetings over the last week, shared my situation, and I'm still not feeling any better.  I've talked it through with my friends I've met through the program, and still no help.  What I'm stuck on is that no one I've talked to understands what it's like to live in this fear.  What happens in these conversations is that I have to explain all the basics of being in an abusive relationship, and such, but still the people I've talked to just don't understand.  (I'm not explaining this well, hopefully you all can get the idea)

My sponsor tells me to do the following (she tells me this whenever I'm struggling), which I've done, and am feeling worse than before.  Go to a meeting, do something nice for others, call another alcoholic, do something to help alleviate the problem.  She won't give advice beyond that, even though I told her that I've done all the things and am feeling worse off today.

I keep thinking about all the people that have been so proud of me for the last 14 months, both in and out of the program, and the thought of letting them all down is crushing.  But at the same time, I just want some release from this fear and despair.  I know getting effed up won't fix anything, but all I can think of is wanting a few hours of release.

So yah,  I don't know exactly what I'm looking for posting here, but I have no idea where else to turn.

EDIT: I suppose I'm looking for advice on how to get through these urges to drink, as opposed to how to deal with the ex (although, I won't turn that away)",14,0

I decided that I wouldn't go to a meeting that day.

But then a week or so ago I went to a different meeting and unexpectedly picked up a sponsee. And we agreed to have our first step work session on Sunday morning at 10 and then walk to a meeting together at 11.

OK, I thought. I'll do AA from 10 to 12 and then again from 4 till about 5. That's it.

Then at the 11 a.m. meeting, a couple of fellows persuaded me to go to fellowship. I wanted to say no. But I couldn't think of any reason to. So I went to lunch and had a deep, insightful conversation with a couple of newcomers. 

I showed up at 4 to clean the basement and, sure enough, we were done by 5. But then the fellow who organized the cleaning session said we should have a meeting, right then and there. I didn't want to. I'd already been to a meeting that day. I wanted to go home and hang out with my girlfriend. But I heard something in his voice that suggested that he needed it. So a few of us stuck around and had a meeting.

My whole day was hijacked by AA. But it was one of the best days I've had in a long time. And all I had to do was be willing.

I'm a creature of habit at restaurants. I like to go to the same places and order the same things, the things I know I like. That way, I'm never disappointed. But it occurred to me recently that I can't grow as an eater this way. So lately, I've been making an effort to be more adventurous, to go to more places and try things I might normally shun.

I nearly posted this to /r/stopdrinking but thought it may be a better fit here. 

I just got some pretty rough news that will negatively impact my career indefinitely. I deserve this outcome, but I'm used to getting away with things, and not used to getting what I deserve when it comes to significant punishments and consequences. 

When I got this news on Monday (via email), my heart sunk, my vision went black, and I felt like I might pass out. It sounds dramatic, but that was my reaction, and I'm choosing not to be embarrassed by it. I waited the 30 seconds that it took to feel my limbs again, and took a walk out of the office. I went outside, lit a smoke and started to lose it a bit. 

I then put out the smoke, and walked toward the water. Water seems to help: fountain, river, lake, you name it. I walked toward the water and without any thought immediately recited the third step prayer on repeat to myself for about three minutes. I felt some semblance of acceptance soon after.

I'll admit I'm in fear right now. Economic security, relations and pride are all under attack. I'm in fear but for a moment, within ten minutes of receiving that message, I had a sense of acceptance and it hasn't totally left me. 

I'm equal parts scared and sure that things are going to be okay. It's funny how that works: a single mind embodying equal and opposite thoughts. 

I'm really grateful I've worked toward the third step and I had the reaction to use it when faced with a challenging turn of events.

Religion(Christianity) is nothing new to me. I was raised Catholic and I have been to all of the churches. I don't believe in a God and would be lying to myself and everyone around if I were to say I did and will. 

I go to AA on my own because I am an Alcoholic and I admit that I have a problem. Going to the meetings and listening to people speak confirms this to me. It's humbling and comforting to know that I am not the only asshole who is this way. 

On top of going to AA I've started going back to the gym to put my energy into more positive activities. It really helps with my anxiety. 

I have a sponsor now(since yesterday) and I realized that most the steps include giving yourself up to Jesus. Frankly this makes me uncomfortable. I believe the steps are solid otherwise. 

I guess my question is, are there any Atheists out there that got sober with the help of this program? It's made out like if you don't give yourself up to God you're going to fail. There are athiests out there who have gotten sober so I don't believe it's impossible. 

Am I in the wrong place? Are there other programs out there that would be better suited for me? 

Anyone else have this issue? If so, what did you do to work through it? 

Thank you!


Edit: Wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to respond and speak on their experience. I live in the midwest and the majority of people in the AA I attend our Christians. That and the Lords Prayer spoken every day is what threw me off. I dont have a problem with anyone believing in anything. I was just worried that Christianity was going to be forced on me. I see that it isnt the case. 

I've spoken to my Sponsor and he was understanding and encouraging. I've decided to make my God the AA program. It's clearly a powerful program that works. What I've been doing doesn't work. Today I have to read through the opinions in the book and go over it with my sponsor. 

I've also joined the community r/AthiestTwelveSteppers. I believe that it helps to have as much support as possible. 

There is a Unitarian Universalist Church that meets up once a week. They work a different program similar to AA. Unfortunately I won't be able to make it to that because they meet in the evening and I work nights. I may check the church out though because it sounds appealing to me. 

I will be saving this post and will come back to it. 

Again thank you for all the responses.  It was very helpful and I very much appreciate it. If anyone ever wants to DM me they can. Know that I work nights and I may not be able to respond as quickly as I'd like to.",17,0

It's crazy, it feels like the longest two years and like they were over in the blink of an eye at the same time. 

The program has given me my life back, plain and simple. I have never forgotten how I felt when I was drowning in the bottle. I have not forgotten the feeling of looking up and seeing myself drowning and not being able to do anything about it.

I use that. Every day. To remind me what I've accomplished, to remind me what I've left behind. And to remind myself that I am one moment of weakness away from going back to that life, that mindset I had. And I don't know about you people, but I like this sobriety thing.

I started working four months after getting sober as a cook. A year later I got promoted to sous chef. Apparently all this motivation and hard work I used to drink before, when applied to positive areas of your life, does yield results. I've had stressful days and days when I've said fuck my life fuck the world, but those are things I can deal with in a healthy way due to the stuff I'm learning in the rooms about myself.

I'm no saint, trust me. I have my flaws, and my moods, and my personality ""quirks"". But I always try to remedy myself and my reactions to things. It's definitely a work in progress. But I'm damn proud of myself how far I've come along.

I got my family back. Aside from sobriety, they are the most important thing in my life. And the amount of gratitude I have for that makes my heart want to explode with emotion.

This weekend I celebrate 7 years without a drink, but I find myself having a bad day (days really). My emotions have been all over the place and I feel my positivity is stretched very thin, almost to break. Life has made some crazy turns and current events bring unexpected stress in places that usually offer therapy. My relationship fell apart back in August, but apparently I/we managed to drag it's rotting corpse along until now, weekend at Bernie's style. Work + constant layoffs, relationship bs + friendship (most friends are gone and my ex is my best friend)+ new family (her and her kids) + stock market + politics + Facebook nonsense (I'm even trying to take a break from that, which leaves me ""disconnected"" from friends) + concert cancellation + concern for elder parents and so on and so forth, are all problematic and wearing me down.

I'm not writing this for sympathy, maybe a little tooting of my own horn, but mostly just sharing. 

With all of this stress, sadness, loneliness, pain, anger...... I never once have thought about taking a drink. Over the course of the past few months, with the break up and other stresses. I've been able to see a better me. A me that doesn't lose his shit because things aren't going his way. Someone that actually deals with things (maybe in the wrong way) instead of just drinking them under a rug until they rot my mind and future. The old me would drink and let it all well up. All the regret and all the contempt would multiply and be set free once the booze dissolves my will power and ability to really think things through. 

All that would be unleashed on her, her kids and my friends, for no reason, but none of that is happening and I see it. I recognize what it means and I feel pride. 

If you find that the emotions in life are testing you.  Know that the sober you will be the better captain of the ship that is your life. The shit may pile on, but it will be far harder to get out if all your best tools are dulled and diminished. 

Keep up the good fight. I have faith in you! It's nice on this side and I hope you get to join me (if you lose your way, you are always welcome back here). 1 day of sobriety is no less meaningful than 7 years. It's not a contest and simply playing the game means you're winning.

 ""When World War II broke out, this spiritual principle had its first major test. A.A.'s entered the services and were scattered all over the world. Would they be able to take discipline, stand up under fire, and endure the monotony and misery of war? Would the kind of dependence they had learned in A.A. carry them through? Well, it did. They had even fewer alcoholic lapses or emotional binges than A.A.'s safe at home did. They were just as capable  of endurance and valor as any other soldiers. Whether in Alaska or on the Salerno beachhead, their dependence upon a Higher Power worked. And far from being a weakness, this dependence was their chief source of strength.""",79,0

I have nothing against weed (medical political recreational) but I feel it's affecting my commitment to the AA program and truly hindering real progress. I recently just went through step 1 again and replaced the word alcohol with weed. I feel confused because I always thought alcohol was the most destructive vice and I gave bud a pass. I feel very fearful of relapsing with drinking or both if both are gone. does anyone have any thoughts or experiences? Thanks,11,0

Today, I completed steps 6 and 7. It was very moving and spiritual, and wanted to share the experience, strength, and hope with y‚Äôall.

I went on a hike with my sponsor and some friends from the program, my dog in tow. We trekked along, which was a little challenging, as I am 6 days into a 30 day fast. Every sensation in my body was extremely heightened, my legs felt tired, my heart beat was like a drum. But my mind was at peace, I felt comfortable and at ease. My sponsor and one friend were nearly running up the mountain - my other friend and I hung back and took it easy. We shared a sentiment about how sometimes people have a different pace in life. It is not good or bad, just different.

We reached a plateau, my sponsor asked if this would be a good place to sit quietly for a while. I obliged. The view of the mountains and the desert in bloom with wild flowers was surreal. Surely a work only a Divine Creator could achieve. The air was filled with fresh air and the sound of His creations singing His praise.

After some idle chit-chat, we read steps 6 and 7 out of the big book. My friends left me to my solitude with God, and I began to pray. I looked through each resentment, fear, and relationship, making sure I had taken an honest look at myself and did not leave out any character defects. My Higher Power revealed to me that I had left some things out, I added those to my inventory.

I opened my list of character defects and prayed on each and every one. The book speaks of hanging on to some of them, having a desire to let go of some, but not all. I did not experience this. Through prayer, I saw that by letting go of each of these, I will better be able to perform His work. I am God‚Äôs agent, and if I perform His work well, he will provide me with all I need. These character defects no longer serve me, because they do not serve my Higher Power.

I laid myself down on the rock, basking in the sunlight of his love and forgiveness. I began to meditate. My meditation started by visualizing each character defect as a manifestation in my body as a dark and murky void of energy. With each deep inhale, I visualized breathing in the beauty and fullness of the universe, bright and full of energy and color. The sunlight entered my third eye and moved this energy throughout my body. I continued with this until all of the darkness was replaced with a radiant bright shining white light.

The final step of my meditation, I focused on balancing my chakras. With each chakra, I visualized a beautiful thing in the nature surrounding me, and breathed in its color and energy, moving it to a location in my body with the light still radiating into my third eye. When this concluded, I pictured my silhouette. Beaming with white radiant light, full of God‚Äôs love and purpose.

My friends, I was rocketed into the fourth dimension. I drifted away, basking in the beauty of the universe, feeling a sense of peace. Ease and comfort that I have never experienced before. Cradled in the hand of my Divine Creator. I gently awoke to the voices of trusted and loved friends nearing me. I am truly blessed.",14,0

I‚Äôll be honest it wasn‚Äôt a perfect 60 days.  There is a lot that has changed this time around, but still tons I need to continue to work on if I want to live in the inner circle of this wonderful program and sober life. 
The biggest thing that has changed is my spirituality. Something I‚Äôve never had in the last 5 years of trying to get sober. It‚Äôs changed my perspective on a lot, and I‚Äôve become a more honest man today than I have ever been. Through honesty though there can be pain, but the pain of not being honest became to great, and the pain I feel today compared to the pain of dishonesty is a lot better feeling. This pain comes from getting into the uncomfortable, and learning to grow. This pain comes from changing old behaviors, and hopefully learning new ones. Behaviors that will better serve me. To teach me, and make me a person who lives with integrity and loves with openness. 
I accept the mistakes I‚Äôve made, but that‚Äôs what they are, mistakes. No mistake is not worth forgiving yourself over, because I know there are people who have made the same ones as me, and I won‚Äôt be the last. Through this pain, people have shared their experience, and what they did to grow and change. If that means that I can do the same for someone in the future with my experience, then I am more then willing now to be open to that service. 
I pray to my higher power everyday that I continue to do their will. My will just doesn‚Äôt serve me or who I want to be anymore, and that is what I accept on this day.

Let me start out by sharing I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic and codependent, and the adult child of an alcoholic. I have spent a huge portion of my life being a people pleaser, a survival skill that served me well as a child and as an adult I am learning to find healthier ways to cope. I‚Äôve had experiences that left me with PTSD (treated now, and I am daily doing better) and my rock bottom was last year before I went into treatment. My addiction to alcohol cost me my job and my marriage, and today I have progressed in my work of the twelve steps, therapy, and self-help to an extent and I look forward to more progress in the future.

That being said, a few weeks ago I was injured while trying to stop a family member‚Äôs vehicle from rolling down a hill. I gave myself validation after that I did all I could to stop it (there was no damage to the vehicle or the occupants) and I was happy that in spite of being hurt I recognized this wasn‚Äôt my bottom, and that my emotional and spiritual hurt last year was greater than my current physical pain. In the process of stopping the vehicle, I was pulled underneath it and run over by the driver‚Äôs side front wheel. I have eight broken ribs, a broken sternum, and a broken collarbone, and nine areas of road rash that needed to be bandaged and dressings changed daily. Through this I have been positive and thankful through this experience, until this morning.

I have episodes of sadness and remorse concerning my marriage at times, and this morning while cleaning my wounds before getting fresh dressing I broke down missing my wife and lamenting that despite frequent attempts in the last year by me to make things right, she has moved on and is not interested in offering forgiveness or reconciling with me. I am struggling with acceptance, and in light of the Covid isolation imposed on us compounded with my injuries, I felt the need to reach out this morning for help. Any encouragement is appreciated.

One last small triumph I would like to share - I was given a prescription for oxycodone upon discharge from the hospital that I chose not to have filled with my history of addiction. My pain is tolerable on ibuprofen and Tylenol, and that success means a great deal to me.

My friend had emphasized the absolute necessity of demonstrating these principles in all my affairs. Particularly was it imperative to work with others as he had worked with me. Faith without works was dead, he said. And how appallingly true for the alcoholic! For if an alcoholic failed to perfect and enlarge his spiritual life through work and self-sacrifice for others, he could not survive the certain trials and low spots ahead.

i‚Äôve earned five years by not taking a drink or a drug, one day at a time, one negative thought at a time, and leaning into that microscopic kernel of faith that my life could be different than it had been for so long. make your faith broad and roomy, make it whatever you need it to be.

you in the fellowship were so kind and welcoming to me when i was the most scared i‚Äôve ever been, and helped me more than you could ever imagine. i just sat and listened for a long long time, and i found serious recognition and newfound hope through all of your stories. sloooowly but surely i gained a little more courage with each sober day. i feel so lucky today to have a design for living, because what i learn here guides me through how to live my life every day. to the newcomer: do not give up. you can do this, just for today. please keep coming back. so much love üôå",100,0

492,50 Years Sober Today.,415,frfjrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/frfjrs/50_years_sober_today/,55,1585523869.0,"Today is the 50th anniversary of my sobriety.

IT WORKS!

March 29 was Easter Monday, the day I hit my personal rock bottom, after a disastrous marriage, and being a daily drunk since I was 18.

The rock bottom came when I became afraid of what might happen during one of my frequent blackouts, as it was something I said or did during one, that ended my first marriage 2 months before.

I went to my first meeting that night, still drunk and distraught, after ringing the Melbourne AA telephone recorded message line.

It was 3 weeks or so before my 28th Birthday.

The kindness of the members at that meeting, together with their practical advice,\* got me started immediately.

I have not taken an alcoholic drink since that day.

50 years of a new life, 48 years of a loving and stable new family, and an opportunity to grow into a decent human being, finding meaning and contentment.

Not all easy though, some rough patches, that is life, after all.

The fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and the power of example (Positive AND negative), sustained me.

The Spiritual aspect got me on a  ""Pilgrimage"" of many paths.

The founders and their circumstances were divinely Inspired in my opinion, as are the 12 Steps and 12 Traditions.

Immense gratitude from Peter H, Melbourne, Australia.

I used to be a binge drinker when I was a teenager (because England) and then had a few years when I didn't drink too often, it turned into a very social thing but I definitely tended to drink way more than I should on the odd occasion that I did have anything.

Then 5 years ago there was a death in my wife's family, which sent us both into a bit of a downward spiral. It started out as us having a toast to her grandmother with her favourite drink (gin and tonic) every night for a week or 2, but it soon turned into a far more frequent and heavy drinking session under the guise of a toast.

It quickly developed into experimenting with making cocktails at home, and coincided with the boom of great craft beer in the UK. About 6 months after the death, we moved to America and the choice of new beers, whisky and gins that we had never tried was exponential, and the daily drinking became a huge thing. We'd get home from work every day and drink a litre of gin between the 2 of us over the course of an evening or 2, but our tolerance was so high that we weren't even that drunk and we rarely had hangovers.

We then slipped into a habit of taking tramadol and diazepam on a daily basis (because America) and would frequently black out. The one time that really stands out as the point I realised it was becoming a big problem was we went out for dinner after drinking a few (very strong) gin and tonics, and about 30mg of diazepam plus tramadol each. We both woke up the next day and we had completely blacked out. It took us an hour to even figure out where we'd been for dinner and what we'd had, but unfortunately we were so far gone that nothing changed and we continued the following evening.

My wife then found a very irresponsible Dr who prescribed her 90 2mg xanax with a monthly refill, which sent us into further spiral. At one point we were drinking 2 litres of gin, a litre of bourbon and a few 4 packs of 7-8% ABV beers between us over the course of 2 or 3 days. The fact my wife was in a very well paid job didn't help matters at all.

When we moved back to the UK we said that it was going to stop, but we continued along the same trajectory for another 18 months until it got to the point where my wife was having a mental breakdown every night when we got into bed, making me promise we weren't going to drink for a week. Then the following day she would come into the living room with 2 drinks in hand, and me being in my selfish bubble of dependency was unable to decline.

We decided half way through January that we were actually going to do it, and set a target of a month sober. It was pretty awful timing as I'd just started a new, very stressful job, my wife has been unemployed for a long time and my dad was diagnosed with cancer in December, and told in January that he had 3 to 6 months to live. Amazingly, I have somehow managed to keep going in spite of this. It's been incredibly difficult at times and I have strong cravings a couple of times a week, but I've continued to refrain.

I never thought I would make it this far, but now that I have I want to continue for as long as I can. I feel very much that I could now have a social drink or 2 and not fall back into my old habits, but with the current situation with all of the pubs being closed, we've decided that we're going to wait at least until the end of coronavirus chaos before we have a drink because if we start drinking at home again it could soon undo all the good work we've done to date. Amazingly I still have 2 full bottles of whisky and a bottle of gin that we have left over from Christmas and I haven't had a sip! 

I know it's not that long in the grand scheme of things but I feel an incredible sense of pride in myself and my wife for reaching this milestone as I never thought we'd get this far üôÇ",18,0

However, much like we are accountable to ourselves and our fellows to uphold the 12 steps and 12 traditions, we are also accountable to become knowledgable in the workings of Zoom to prevent such occurrences. Wide spread use of host-muting, limiting group chatting, and implementing a waiting-room feature before online meetings have all been suggested as viable solutions for this issue, and yet we still find ourselves in this forum complaining about the ""sick people"" who crash the meetings.

&#x200B;

For those less versed in internet trolling culture, ""sick people"", ""people sicker than us"", ""people sicker than addicts"" are all forms of reinforcement that trolls seek to know they've accomplished their purpose. Leave the sensationalism at the door and ignore them. They browse our forums as much as they browse their own, and the seek out posts where users are clearly upset by their trolling actions to reaffirm that they accomplished their intended goal. Maybe they're sick, maybe (and most likely) they're just teenage users who are equally bored during this quarantine.

&#x200B;

For zoombombing to disappear, we have to eliminate our sensationalized speech in group conversation, online posting, etc. and improve our own skills in using zoom. At this point, we should have a full grasp of the host ""Mute-all"" function, closed group chatting, and waiting rooms should be employed for any and all meetings held online.",26,0

So, I turned 10 today. I had envisioned it looking a bit different; thought I would be able to celebrate with my sponsor and sponsee. We get to see each other tonight over zoom and I‚Äôm going to take a virtual cake, so that‚Äôs pretty cool. 

I just want to say that everything I have is a direct result of this program. I have a marriage, a baby, a home, a job (even though I‚Äôm currently furloughed), family, everything. I am beyond grateful. A lot has happened in the last ten years. One of things I am most proud of is winning the respect of my Dad before he passed away. By the time I got sober, my dad was pretty much done with my bullshit. He didn‚Äôt talk to me at all in my first month of sobriety. When it was time to make amends, he did not want to hear it. He didn‚Äôt really think much of AA and was a staunch atheist. It took years for he and my stepmom to trust me enough to help out during his many health troubles. Right after he was diagnosed with cancer, when I was about 7 years sober, my Dad sat me down with tears in his eyes and said, ‚ÄúI see the life you live, and I‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù The most important thing to my father was that, as he said, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre going to talk the talk, you better walk the walk.‚Äù In his opinion, I was walking the walk. 

If you are new and you can‚Äôt imagine life without a drink, it is possible. When I was new and I saw people take cakes for multiple years, and I just didn‚Äôt believe that it was possible. I also want you to know that it is possible to loose the shame, guilt and self-hatred; it just takes a little work. 

If you‚Äôre new, I hope you stay. If you have relapsed (as I had in the past), I hope you know we love you and that AA will always be your home.

I‚Äôve also had a few days when I‚Äôve had pretty decent cravings, though I didn‚Äôt seriously consider going to the store the thought did cross my mind a lot more frequently than it typically has the last few months. I haven‚Äôt drank in almost 18
months so the cravings struck me in their intensity and frequency after quarantine started.

So today I had something of a breakthrough. I had to go to a farm store for some chicken feed. I‚Äôm very careful about the Coronavirus scenario so I wore a mask to the store, and made sure that once back in my car immediately after taking the mask off I‚Äôd sanitize my hands and spray my keys/phone/wallet down with an isopropyl alcohol solution I‚Äôve got in a spray bottle. So I do all this, proceed home and the thought I‚Äômediately hits me to stop at a liquor store on my way back through and craving hits. I get a bit agitated, smoke a cigarette, didn‚Äôt stop or anything but was generally getting hit by a decent craving.

So get back to my house and start unloading, spraying down my stuff with the same solution and the thought hits me. Maybe I‚Äôm having alcohol cravings because after using all the sanitizers my car smells like a fucking distillery. I journal, so sure enough I look at days when I had cravings and every one is a day I had to go out and ended up in my car with the smell of alcohol on the air. Now, it could be that going out in general is more of a trigger but I don‚Äôt think so, I‚Äôve gone out fishing and drove to a mountain biking trailhead a few times, I had no social contact these days and didn‚Äôt sanitize nearly as intensely, and also didn‚Äôt have cravings. I‚Äôm gonna try sanitizing everything outside my car before getting in and driving with the windows down a bit more if I need to go out from this point forward, see how that goes. Figured I‚Äôd post this on here to see if anyone had anything similar they‚Äôve been experiencing or perhaps like me haven‚Äôt made the connection yet.

When I am on here reading, or when I go to online groups, I start to think that perhaps I should get a sponsor.  Perhaps it could be as easy as asking someone, but I have some things I need to work through before I can even get to that point...

- I am a woman.  The bulk of the people I have contact to in AA are men.  I have a history of connecting better to men, but I also have a history of problems with men - from rape to unwanted advances...
- I am an isolater.  When I am struggling with anything I tend to go to ground rather than reach out for help.  My feeling is always that I don‚Äôt want to be needy or overly demanding.  It literally took me months to get to the point where I could text my trauma therapist when I was having a hard time... even now calling her when in crisis would be out of the question for me.  

I am not even really sure about what I am asking... I want a sponsor, but I don‚Äôt want a sponsor.  I am afraid of getting tangled up in a relationship that I don‚Äôt want to be in, but am also aware that I use that reflexive response to keep myself safely isolated.

But today it did totally hit me:    I am SO HAPPY I am sober right now. 

As crappy as this Pandemic & crashing economy has been (and unfortunately will likely get worse before it gets better), it would be FAR worse if I was drinking or otherwise in a non-sober mindset.   

Sometimes we forget as sober people that--even though terrible things still happen like unemployment, death of a loved one, relationship break-ups, other servere economic or health problems, etc.--they would be FAR WORSE (worse in severity, longer in duration, or BOTH) if we were out drinking or otherwise acting like an emotionally unsober person.

The Promises in the Big Book states in part:

*""...That feeling of uselessness and self-pitty will disappear....Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us. .....""*

But when I first got sober I basiclly interpreted it as, *""....You will never be in a bad mood....you will be the most popular person in town and become very wealthy....."".*  Which of course is totally idiotic.  The Promises never promise that you'll never have difficulties or massive challenges or disappointments for the rest of your life.  They just promise you that you'll be able to HANDLE THEM BETTER than before.  And as a result, you do that on a consistent basis, over time three things will happen:  


1. Fewer of those difficulties will happen because you will be significantly avoiding ""self-inflicted"" problems in the first place;  

2. When you do come into a difficulty, you be less fearful when dealing with it; and  

3. As a result, that will help you overcome, resolve, or survive that difficulty in a more effective way such that the difficult does not spiral out of control into ones that become even BIGGER or last even LONGER.

Even 100% perfectly sober Zen Masters of life run into difficult periods. After all, there's very little outside ourselves that we can control.  And in those instances, sometimes the choice is one of ""bad vs EVEN WORSE"" rather than ""bad vs. good"".  But as unpleasant as that choice might be, 100 out of 100 times, I'm going to be greatful to have the ability to steer myself to the ""less bad"" outcome & at least be able to avoid the ""even worse"" one.",10,0

so may 1st was a huge day for me... it's been 1 year - 365 days since i decided to take control of my mental health and quit alcohol.

this year has been the most intense, at times traumatic, yet transformative year of my entire life. i was silently struggling with my ailing mental health & using alcohol to cope for so, so, SO long. over the past 4 years of trying to ""white knuckle"" my way to healing, i have been hospitalized in the ER over 20 times... just this time last year i went to the ER 3 times in 6 days due to my poor decisions of using alcohol to cope & suicidal ideation. the very last time i went it was by the hands of the police due to a welfare check. i have never admitted that on such a public level like this, ever. i finally went to in-patient treatment on may 1st 2019 and my life has dramatically changed for the better.

yoga has been one of the pivotal forms of treatment throughout my recovery journey. so much so that i spent the last year building a business plan, gaining two yoga teaching certifications, executing financial budgets, building a website, building a marketing brand identity, working with the city, creating partnerships and so much more to launch my business.

times are extremely tough right now with the pandemic but people need access to affordable, holistic health outlets especially after all this is over.

i have no plan b. i have put everything i have - money, time, energy, emotional space into this. this is my dream and i will do anything to achieve it. i am not in this to become a millionaire, i am in it to transparently share my story and to help heal those who are suffering, just like i did.

it really is true what they say... the promises do come true. <3

not sure if we are allowed to promote but we are doing a crowdfunding campaign to get this studio built if anyone is interested. if not just happy to know my fellow chicagoans in recovery can see whats to come for the community!

Hey guys. I'm around a week sober today. I have no one to talk to about this because no one in my life knows exactly what's going on between me and alcohol.

Anyway. I wanted to tell someone who it wouldnt cause any hassle to tell, yknow? Someone who would understand what it's seriously like instead of making it feel like something it's not.

So yeah. I've know I've had a problem, on and off for a few years. It's been particularly bad and constant for the last year. Very bad since lockdown.

And I've gone without for about a week. Not feeling particularly strong, so I'm not thinking ahead. I'm just putting my energy into living in the moment and getting through one moment at a time, to the point where I haven't counted the hours or days. But I know it was just before last weekend that I last drank.

So yeah... thanks for listening, if you read this",21,0

615,One year sober,94,ggqn3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/ggqn3b/one_year_sober/,28,1589068413.0,"I've  been sober since May 5th last year and stopped without AA or rehab, i  had been drinking heavily for years and it was getting dangerously bad.

The  withdrawls from my last episode scared me so bad that i stopped  drinking for Six months, but like a lot of people no matter how bad it  is, you think you will never forget how bad and scared you felt and will  never go there again, but the longer time passes the more the memory of  it fades until somehow you think it wasn't as bad as you remember or  because it's been so long you now have it under control, like i did.

I  had a weeks holiday from work last April and felt like it's been so  long that i can have a drink and promised myself no matter how much i  enjoyed it i would stop after one day but i just could not put the vodka  down.

I drank around 5 litres of  vodka over the next so many days at home and caught a glimpse of the  bottles of piled in the corner and it only hit me then that i was even  worse than before, i hadn't eaten in days as is always the case when i'm  a mess like that (impossible by this stage) i hadn't realized just how  much i had drank and stopped right there.

Then  as the booze started wearing off i got the intense panic going from i  will never drink again to just one more sip to ease the anxienty, i felt  like i was going to have a panic attack, and my body felt like it  wanted to fit, i felt like i had to keep moving around or my body would  seize up, pacing around the house sweating, heart beating in my throat.

I  lay in bed for days, sweating, intense never ending diarrhea, drinking  lots of water, eating almost zero, my mouth and tongue was a mess  because i had been drinking straight vodka like water, trying to sleep  with sleeping tablets, they didn't work.

I  had auditory and visual hallucinations, auditory was really bad and  lasted a couple of days, i felt like i was going mad and this would be  how i was for the rest of my days, feelings of total despair knowing i  had nobody to blame but me.

I had  taken a couple of extra sick days from work and went back feeling  terrible, i have a physical job and had half the day done struggling  badly, zero sleep or food for days and then my heart started to race and  beat harder than i've ever felt and started to get involuntary  movements, like i was going to have a fit (never had one before), i  ended up having to call an ambulance at work and was in hospital for  three days on valium and a drip having tests done.

Rather  than be in hospital panicking about my situation and the state i was in  i felt at peace, (valium may have helped) like this could be the thing  that cements my resolve to stop drinking as i doubt i could survive much  more of this, and it has been so far, just over one year sober.

Being  in hospital and the the terrible state i was in along with my brother,   who also has a drinking problem (been to rehab and relapsed), recently  having a fit and smashing his head open in front of his kids when  detoxing is enough to push the thought of drinking from my mind,  although i do still have the thoughts, less and less as time passes, i  know there is NO WAY i can ever go back to that.

Up  until not too long ago i remember thinking to myself i will never ever  stop drinking until i die because i loved it so much and it's what i do,  now  it's been a year and i can't see a time i WILL be drinking in the  future but i can't say for sure as tomorrow is another day.

I  think hitting your lowest point is enough for some of us to stop when  previously it seemed totally impossible, when you get in such an extreme  situation that it can shock you into action and stick with you for a  long time.

It was one of those  times you swear, if i survive this i will stop 100% that i had said many  times before but i couldn't have meant it more seriously this time and  stuck to it.

Going from how terribly bad i felt back then to waking up feeling normal  and being able to go to work and funtion and do things feels like such a  reward and reminds me that i can't ever go back to drinking.

I still have by  job, recently got into motorcycles, passed my test and bought a nice  bike at the age of 42 so that's my thing now instead of drinking myself  to oblivion.

I'm a very average peson, did not consider myself very determined but here i am a year later still sober, i wish you all the best, there is hope for everyone.",94,0

I've had a couple of episodes of abusing substances but nothing like what's happening during coronavirus. I am on a sliiiide down into hell.

I have a high pressure job that didn't previously embrace working from home at all. For 2 months I've been working from my place on several overlapping high-stake projects and when I need to check in I have been drinking to get myself relaxed enough to participate. Most days I need to have a drink before the first set of meetings, then stay moderately intoxicated for the balance of the day. These first meetings start at 9 so I am drinking by 8 many mornings.

On days I do drink, which is probably 4/7 in a week, up to 5/7 days of a week, I feel the huge depressive aspect of the alcohol and it destroys my mood, it destroys my sleep cycle and it is causing havoc on my body.

My issue isn't so much about acknowledging that I have a problem - I very clearly do have a bad problem. My issue is finding a place to get to some effective meetings going so I can attempt to curtail it. I want to get additional perspectives so that this can be reversed before it gets much worse. A few times I've needed to lay down on my bed in the middle of the day, which is absolutely crazy with the projects I am on and it is a recipe for disaster. I am actively destroying personal relationships in my life too. How my girlfriend hasn't left me (we don't live togehter) I do not know.

On days I don't drink I am absolutely noticeably happier, even to myself. I'll drink coffee and tea all day and will feel amazing. I know my brain needs/wants me to stop drinking like this. It is crazy how substance abuse makes a person almost ""seek"" something that causes them pain and dysphoria. For this reason alone I would know I have a problem. But I see many other things it threatens to destroy too.

I need to stop, I am by myself and in a white knuckle freefall. Thankful that you are all here. I hope you're all doing better than I am.

This is something what I thought would not be possible. 100 days ago I was at a all time low. I would drink a pint of vodka while driving home everyday because I knew the beer at home wouldn‚Äôt be enough. My last drink was on Super Bowl Sunday. Started with that one drink I thought I could handle but ended up drinking a fifth of gin. Woke up the next morning not remembering the game or that I filled the bottle back up with water thinking I could trick my wife about how much I actually drank. That was it for her, she was done with all of the lies. 

About to lose my wife and kids I knew I had to change. After white knuckling it for a week I went to a behavioral clinic. Doctor tells me to go to AA, which I rolled my eyes at because I just spent good money to see a doctor because I did not want to go to AA. I was looking for a easier softer way, like some kind of cure all pill.  I was scared of the unknown. What really went on in those rooms? Who are those people really? Would I be joining some kind of cult? I was also terrified of the stigma that I thought I would get by attending AA.

A couple of days later I started to feel like I deserved a drink because I have been doing so well. Instead knowing what was on the line and that I could not stop after one, I went to a meeting. Have to say it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I have never felt at home in a group of strangers like this before. Everyone welcomed me, reassured me that I was in the right place and told me that they were happy I was there. Also made sure I had a list of meeting, phone numbers, a copy of the Big Book and told me to keep coming back. These people I could actually resonate with unlike my wife, doctors and therapists. They actually know what I am going through because they have been there themselves. They openly share their experiences with alcohol in a judgement free space. By listening to their experiences you will gain strength and hope from them. They will give you the tools you need to fight this disease. You do not have to do this by yourself, you should not do this by yourself. If someone is fighting cancer they seek help. 

To anyone that is on the fence about attending AA just go check it out. Attend a few meetings from different groups because they are all unique. Take the information that you like and leave the rest. AA is free you have nothing to lose just so much to gain. It is anonymous (hence the AA name), what is said in the room stays in the rooms. There is no stigma that comes along with AA. Everyone will be proud that you are doing what is right for you. And as someone who always thought he was atheist, no one there is going to shove God down your throat. It‚Äôs not a Religious program it is a Spiritual program. You find your own Higher Power, which really is a beautiful thing. Trust me this is the easier softer way. 

I have gained so much more then just sobriety. I get to remember putting my kids down for bed. I am gaining the trust back with my wife. I have found Faith in my Higher Power. I wake up in the morning remembering dreams and feeling amazing. I no longer have an internal battle waging inside me. I have not felt this good physical and mentally in a very long time. I have an awesome fellowship of men and women, that I know will be there for me no matter what. I owe so much to AA and look forward to paying it back for years to come.

June 4 will mark my one-year anniversary of being sober. I‚Äôm very excited about it, and enthusiastic and optimistic about the personal growth that I‚Äôm making. I‚Äôm attending zoom meetings, and I honestly miss some of the intimacy from being in person at my home group.

That being said, my alcoholism contributed greatly to the decline of my marriage. My wife left me last year, in our divorce was final in November. For the most part we have been cordial, sharing the two dogs that we both love and generally getting along.

I honestly did not want to divorce, and after treatment I realized that the alcohol had been numbing my good feelings as well as bad. About a month ago, I received a phone call from her out of the blue that lasted for about an hour and a half. She had a lot that she wanted to say to me, and some of it were things that I had really wanted to hear. She apologized for things that she had done the head put strain on our marriage, said that the divorce was something that she really didn‚Äôt want, and how she was sorry that she had not supported me through treatment and through a recent accident I had, and how she wanted to reconnect and to go out on dates and see if feelings still remained. I was as reserved as I was able to be, and thanked her for the things that she said, I said that I would be willing to see if we could reconcile. She sent me a message afterwards thanking me for the good conversation and telling me she was looking forward to reconnecting.

I didn‚Äôt hear more for a couple of weeks, and then she contacted me to let me know that she had changed her mind I did not want to reconnect. She has told me that she has trouble seeing me as a person, and that she still does not trust me or respect me.

I had not intended to, but I had got my hopes up after a good conversation, and I took the reversal of her opinion pretty hard. I did not relapse and remained in recovery, and I am happy about that, but depression hit me hard for a few days.

I established some boundaries with her about not communicating with her more until she is able to see the person that I am in recovery and not the person that I was in my addiction. Boundaries are extremely hard for me and some thing that I work on becoming stronger at every day. Historically I am a people pleaser and I avoid conflict, and I‚Äôm trying not to internalize her perspective as fact. 

The purpose of this post is just to share what happened and to reaffirm my commitment to my recovery. if I make new friends here that is wonderful. I want to reaffirm that the person that I am in recovery is not the same person that I was in active addiction, and that fact is more important than the way other people look at me.

641,100 Days Today!,64,glyrmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/glyrmm/100_days_today/,11,1589796575.0,"I was a tongue chewing, babbling, semi functional, miserable drunk for years.   I was kicked out of my house by my wife and kids right before Xmas.  For years, I had lied (poorly) to try to hide my disease and just meandered through life without being present.  I was a part-time husband, dad, boss, employee, friend and brother because I was a full-time alchoholic.  And, I was exhausted.  A 1/5th of vodka all day, every day will do that.  I deserved my fate.

I detoxed myself (NOT RECOMMENDED) doing the shake, shiver and sweat dance for 4 or 5 days after ruling out residential rehab (TOO ARROGANT).  I dabbled in AA in early January.  As soon as I made it into the rooms and admitted I was an alchoholic, I felt my shame start to fall away.  I was amazed by the Big Book and by my fellow AA members.  Even though I attended a meeting every day, I didnt fully surrender.  

After two relapses in January and early February, both with escalating consequences....I came to truly understand the perfect description of booze ...""cunning, baffling, powerful"".  My final relapse confirmed what I knew but was too proud to admit prior.   I was  beaten.  Alchohol kicked my ass.  

At that point, I surrendered fully to God, found a sponsor (by Grace) and got to work.  The steps taught me humility and forgiveness.  The steps have given me tools to live by.  And to live happily and without booze.  

I've made it back into the house.  I'm present.  I'm fucking happy!  But, I know my disease is lurking and watching me so I stay vigilant with daily meditation, prayer and outreach to the fellowship wherever and whenever I can.  God Bless all of us on this journey.",64,0

645,A Word to Alcoholics New to Recovery,24,gn3awh,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/gn3awh/a_word_to_alcoholics_new_to_recovery/,10,1589943257.0,"SO, if you‚Äôve gone any period of time without drinking, go you! You should be proud of the strength you have within you! But, remember you are strong, not invincible. Regardless of the amount of time you‚Äôve spent sober, a relapse can occur at any time, any place. Remember this;

***Don‚Äôt test yourself (and don‚Äôt bring this newfound sobriety back to your old stomping grounds).***  
It‚Äôs dangerous to think you can go to the same old places, around the same old people and be magically resistant to the urge to fall back into your old lifestyle. Sure, I could go back to that same ol‚Äô bar, order soda, and remain sober that night. But honestly‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the fun it used to be, and that *‚ÄúI‚Äôm not having fun anymore,*‚Äù feeling will sink in, which can lead to one hell of an itch to drink.

***Be open about your sobriety.***  
Letting people around you know you‚Äôre not drinking can help keep you accountable. Sometimes it‚Äôs as simple as that. *Stop overthinking this scenario!*

***You can choose whether to share your story or not.***  
There are times when sharing your journey can be helpful for both you and the other party involved. Your story could greatly impact someone, and potentially save a life! **Share** **in the context of your choosing.**

But you don‚Äôt *have* to explain you‚Äôre an alcoholic or blab about how alcohol and poor decisions have ruined your life. You don‚Äôt *have* to talk about rehab, psych hospitals, jail or your journey unless you *WANT* to! There will be times when sharing your journey can be helpful to you and those around you.

***You don‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation.***  
If it‚Äôs not the time or place for you to share comfortably; *then don‚Äôt*.

You can be casual about your sobriety if you choose. If you tell people you're not drinking, you don‚Äôt have to explain that you have a *problem.* If someone offers a drink, it is totally fine to say things like ‚ÄúNot right now, maybe later,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm driving tonight, so I‚Äôm not drinking.‚Äù Hell, say you‚Äôre on a medication you can‚Äôt drink on‚Ä¶ *LISTEN,* w*hatever* *works*, say it, do it. This is for YOU, not anyone else. There are some situations where talking about your sobriety just isn‚Äôt what you want to do. Maybe you are at a holiday party for work and don‚Äôt feel like sharing that you were a raging blackout-thief-violent-bitch kind of alcoholic. That‚Äôs okay.

***In most situations I do own it.***  
I‚Äôve always had a problem and I‚Äôll always be an alcoholic. So, in the right context, I like to explain how serious it is, and how stringent I am about keeping myself accountable. In a way I‚Äôm asking for others to help keep me accountable too. If I get any type of temptation in my mind, I remember everyone around me would see me if I took a drink. Whether they would actually stop me or not is out of my control. *Let the lingering eyes of others veer you away from drinking.*

***Surround yourself with others who are in recovery;*** **Meeting Guide App.**  
Thankfully there are huge networks of people in recovery. Access to information on AA meetings has been made easily available. A very simple way to find meetings in your area is through the app called Meeting Guide. It lists the days, times and locations of meetings near you (or a location of your choosing). It also provides information such as whether it‚Äôs a closed meeting, Big Book study, speaker meeting, or even if it‚Äôs handicap accessible. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to look!

She gave me some writing and questions to supplement my work through it, and while the first few pertained directly to my perceptions on the reading, the last few made me write out a lot of the stupid shit (and even just recall as i was writing) I have done from drinking. 

I was never a ‚Äúrock bottom‚Äù drinker (though I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs when you stop digging, thank you fellow alcoholics), and I have been going so back and forth between whether I‚Äôm an actual alcoholic or just a typical 25-year-old.

But now I see WHY I was dragging my feet to do my first step. I didn‚Äôt want to take account of all of the damage I‚Äôve done. I wanted to pretend my drunk driving, car accidents I‚Äôve left unclaimed, arguments, danger of myself and others, etc etc didn‚Äôt actually exist. I wanted to continue in the dream that I was just like everyone else, a girl after some fun who has some stupid stories! 

Seeing even just a small fraction written out and then talking through my story with my sponsor made me realize I‚Äôm in for a looooong road in the steps, and I am so glad I found AA, even if I wished I wasn‚Äôt here sometimes. I‚Äôm terrified for the rest of the steps, but I‚Äôm excited.

Everything's reached breaking point at home and my wife wants to leave me as ""I'm always grumpy ""
She isn't wrong. For the past 5 years I've been an absolute dickhead and for the past year I've drunk 140 units a week...a good 100 of those whilst she's been asleep.

I've decided tomorrow I'm going to come clean...She deserves to know and I want to get clean. It's so strange to admit I'm an alcoholic as I don't have like a desire to drink...it just helps me sleep but I guess that's the point...that is the desire.

Alcohol makes me a fucking asshole to the people I love. It makes me gain weight and ruins my mornings. It worsens my anxiety and makes me feel depressed as hell after a night of drinking. What good does it bring? There is no party. I'm 29. The party ended years ago, and now it's just me, sitting at my fucking table doing shots of vodka (which now tastes like water, which is terrifying) by myself. 

I want a family, and a steady job, and a Healthy body. I don't want alcohol to control me anymore. I wish I didn't think I needed it to socialize. Anxiety is a bitch and I have convinced myself that when I'm sober, I'm just a drag to be around. I've always been the ""life of the party"", so I feel like almost part of my identity will be gone.

I drank Thursday night 5/19/20, just a six pack of 16's and made it to bed by ten. Woke up at 2 a.m. drank a coffee, and headed to the hotel, I felt fine. No stumble, clear speech, the works. Hotel serves breakfast but I decide I'm not too hungry, and I get a temperature check, 96.7.. Back in the truck to head towards the Fed.   Building. I get there fine, stand in line waiting to be processed, sergeant loudly exclaims that he smells booze, and the offender better speak up, he just wants to hand them some gum.

I was floored.  I had felt fine.
Next thing you know I'm sitting outside of a navy liaison office hearing about what dumbfuck they have sitting outside, and about how I should be behind bars.
I wait for three more hours before someone telling me that my recruiter can't be reached, and I would have to wait. I asked if I was being detained, and if I could leave. I was told ""as long as you have a ride"" I called my mother to pick me up. She has a beer in hand as she pulls in and immediately starts berating me about my results. That was three days ago.

Because I dropped my defenses and I was affectionate and caring and empathetic and patient with him, while he was just mirroring my own personality and being manipulative. While he was playing me. I showed him complete and total empathy and kind and gentle and nurturing through my affections and I never get vulnerable enough to do that. And I did it because he made me feel safe enough to let my guard down and be affectionate. I would talk about being in a relationship and he never shut the idea down, he entertained it even, not until the bomb dropped that he was in a whole other long term pseudo relationship with another woman that he was hiding from me. He kept telling me he was busy with work and his son, when he was just too busy to have two girlfriends. 

He never wanted me for more than sex and someone to vent to, but he assured me that he did want more. He said it in plain, precise language. We had sex more affectionate than I‚Äôve ever had with anyone, and I held myself while I sheepishly asked him if that was all he wanted from me after it was over. And he told me no. He told me he wanted more. And for once I wasn‚Äôt being treated like I was only worth what someone could get from me. For once someone wanted me for me. And then he held me all night and we fell asleep together. It was the first thing I had asked and it gave me hope. And he made me feel like my love was safe with him.

And what hurt was to not only have that hope ripped from my hands, but to be lied to unknowingly for all that time, and then for that to be revealed to me not even by his own mouth, and to be humiliated and pushed to the ground in the process, and then invalidated, made to feel worthless, and suddenly in a position where I was second best, like always. But this time I wasn‚Äôt given any notice that I was. I was sidelined, and was delivered the news on a random morning through a vicious text by a woman who felt triumph over ‚Äúwinning‚Äù him in favor of him choosing me, and then rubbed it in my face and demeaned my worth to nothing. When I never even knew she existed. And now not only did I have to mourn the loss of suddenly not having him at all and suddenly being absolutely nothing to him, but also had someone to compare myself to, to add insult to injury. And I think what hurts the most is that I don‚Äôt know why these things happen to me. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm always not good enough. Not wanted. Not lovable. And why it is that *every single time* I get back on my feet, and try to reach out, no matter how cautious I am, no matter how many different approaches I take, no matter how many preventative measures I take, somehow I am always shot back down. And even when I feel secure in it, even just for once, the rug is always pulled out from beneath me. And it becomes an option of either trying again to open up and accept others in and get vulnerable, or to close myself off totally, and don‚Äôt put the opportunity on the table so It‚Äôs a guarantee that I don‚Äôt get hurt. 

I‚Äôve always felt like I wanted to hide myself away from the world. Like I wanted to be shrunken into a spec, so that no one would ever notice my existence. And I‚Äôve always felt like I wanted to run, run far far away but never knew what from, or where to.

And life has always felt so UNFAIR. Like everyone else gets to have good things happen to them and I NEVER do. Like it‚Äôs somehow written in the stars. Because I can try so hard, I can try so hard to be a good person, to be humble, and patient, and self reflecting, and open minded, and kind and generous and loving empathetic and accepting, and try so hard to be the type of person that I believe wouldn‚Äôt deserve to suffer. And I get back on my feet and I settle back into being the generous person I‚Äôve worked so hard to become. And then I take my chances and I open up and I do so hopefully and happily and then I‚Äôm shot right the fuck back down. 

And I‚Äôve never been able to figure out what I did wrong. What I did to deserve never being shown any love by my parents and to be treated like I was nothing, like I was worthless. What I did to deserve to be treated like trash in comparison to my cousins when CPS put my brother and I in my aunt‚Äôs home. What I did to always be the scapegoat. What I did to be called a n-gger by my own mother. To be told she wished she‚Äôd aborted me and that she wouldn‚Äôt care if I died in a ditch with a needle in my arm. 

What I did to never be deserving of kindness or support or uplifting or guidance. 

What I did to always be second best. To never be worth it to someone. To never be the person that someone pines after for more than just my body. To never be someone who was someone‚Äôs first choice. To never even be shown affection. To just always be told that I‚Äôm stupid for even thinking I would be worth that. And then having to pick myself back up from the rubble, alone. Every time. And I don‚Äôt even know what love feels like. 

I‚Äôve never known what it feels like. It‚Äôs like I get these little glimpses that are just right outside of my grasp and then as soon as I go to touch them they disappear into dust. And I imagine what life must be like for other people. Just for ONCE, to be able to lean on someone, anyone, and them welcome it with open arms, like I do for everyone else. Just for ONCE to know what it feels like to be loved by a parent. Just for ONCE to be able to feel wanted and safe and just for ONCE to not feel like the word love is like some kind of acid on my tongue, where I‚Äôm too afraid to even speak it because it holds so much weight and too much potential to fall right through my grip. And not even the romantic infatuation type of love. I just want the love that it takes to be reassured that I‚Äôm not worthless, or to be texted first, or to be complimented out of the blue. It holds all the weight to crush everything that I am and everything that I‚Äôve built myself into. Just for once to feel like I‚Äôm not so alone. Like I am *something* to someone. To anyone. To not feel ashamed for wanting that. And to not feel small and insignificant. And to not feel like I‚Äôve never known anything but. 

Just for once to feel wanted. And to feel like I‚Äôm a human. And to not feel like I‚Äôm just some bland piece of trash on the floor that should be expected to be kicked around. To not feel like I‚Äôm stupid for wanting to be kissed, or for wanting to be hugged, or wanting to be shown that someone cares, or wanting to feel safe or wanting to be able to be vulnerable with someone who won‚Äôt use my trauma to their advantage.


Why I Do Not Need That Drink: 

Because alcohol does not control me. Because I am strong. I might not be stronger than these feelings. And I might not be strong enough to climb out of this rut that I‚Äôm in. But I am strong, and I do not need that drink because alcohol is a poison. And I will not poison myself to make my pain go away. I will not poison myself to forget what I feel. I will sit and be vulnerable with myself and I will not poison my mind and my body. Instead, I will nourish my mind and my body.",57,0

680,The importance of honesty.,10,grweui,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/grweui/the_importance_of_honesty/,10,1590627898.0,"I've been on this journey for over 6 and a half years now. Thanks to my HP I have not had to drink or drug since the day I earnestly decided to get sober and picked up that white chip.

Perhaps the thing I keep coming back to is honesty. In AA they call it rigorous honesty. You could say that my decision to get sober was rooted in honesty: being honest about the fact that I couldn't keep going the way I was and ever expect to live a healthy and happy life. And the whole process since then has been about honesty, too. Honesty about my defects of character, honesty about my weaknesses, and honesty about life and its struggles in general.

The times when I have strayed have been times when I have been less honest. Perhaps the biggest example was just over a year ago, when things started going really well for me and I came to the conclusion that I was ""finished"", in spiritual terms. I really though I had nowhere left to go. And that made me very full of myself. That led to me committing some mistakes that harmed others. Thankfully I realized what I was doing and was able to drop the big ego.

I was left very vulnerable, though. I found this spiritual community online. They advocated using psychedelic drugs as a form of meditation, imagine that. Luckily I didn't, although to be honest I did consider it briefly. A few months ago I started butting heads with them and their leader and thankfully I was able to listen to my heart and get out. But that experience left me with doubts about what it means to be ""rigorously honest"". The leader had seemed to imply that I was not being totally honest with myself... and that made me question what honesty really means.

But I'm starting to have an idea on it now. I think there is what we can call micro-honesty and macro-honesty. Micro-honesty could be something like, ""Why did I choose to send that text message? It must be because I am looking for validation or something similar."" ""Why did I get angry with my wife today? It must be because I am causing her to pay for my bad day."" Or something like that. Basically, it's nit-picking. And to be honest I don't find it very helpful, or even necessary.

What I *do* find necessary is what I call macro-honesty. Let me give you some examples of some macro-honesty in my life:

1. I can't expect to drink and live a happy and fulfilling life.
2. I am still a wounded guy with pains and traumas to work through.
3. Some of my behavior is still a result of my pains and traumas (although no need to nitpick which are and which aren't. The important things tend to be clear without much analysis.)
4. I need support in order to deal with these things.
5. I am responsible for my emotional experience, not other people.
6. I am not better (or worse) than anybody else.
7. Everybody is doing the best they can.

Etc.

If I lie to myself on any of these points, I'm in for trouble. I don't necessarily need to know exactly why I sent a text message, or why I uploaded a photo to Facebook. It's not important! Who cares!?! But if I go around telling myself ""welp, I'm cured, and a beer would be nice right about now!"" then that's not OK.

It's a subtle difference, but one that makes a huge difference.

Finally, it's OK to be honest about the good things, too. It's OK to be honest about the fact that, hey, I'm wounded, but I'm healing. It's OK to trust myself. If not, we'll constantly be pulled one way or another by people who think they know best for us. People never know best for us. The answers are always inside.

And lastly, the fact that I'm not nit-picking or trying to do the ""micro-honesty"" thing, IMHO, is a major sign of healing.

Just wanted to share my experience. I hope this helps somebody. Best wishes!",10,0

I start googling and find a bunch of local escorts, message them and even pick a time and place. I get in the car and remember to take my dog to day care. On the way there, my heart is beating fast, I can sense that dry mouth feeling of anticipation, and I'm asking myself WTF am I doing. A scene flashed in front of me of trying to explain this to my wife/sponsor/daughter - and with that came intense feeling of guilt and shame. I drop the dog and call a sober brother who I know used to regularly hire prostitutes and have sex and cocaine with 2 at a time  before recovery but now has 2 years. We talk and that urge slowly dissapears but not completely. Even though it was sex, that feeling was so strongly similar to my alcohol craving (which I haven't had in 8+ months) that a drink wouldn't have been far off.

I think I have an alcohol problem, well a drinking problem and I'm only 21. Isn't that some shit?

The last 3-4 months, I've been drinking Jack almost exclusively. I like the taste and I like how quick I'm done for. The problem isn't that I can't tell myself ""oh no, no drink tonight"", but if it's near me and I can see it I'm like ""yeah tonight I'm gonna drink."" Another problem is I'm thinking I'm misusing it. I'm using it as a crutch more than anything. I feel down or depressed and think downing a pint and playing games with my friends will make me feel better. 

Currently I'm having a terrible day. Just all around terrible, and all I can think about it ""yeah I'm gonna get drunk"" and now that scares me. Like I finally realized I'm using it for a crutch and I don't want that to be my default.

It sucks being in a pandemic and having this feeling that perhaps I need AA, or therapy, either or, and can't go to it. Never have been to AA (minus once when my mom went and I was but a child) so I'm not used to this. I'm not really used to asking for help either.

Long story short I moved into a new place, had a dispute with the landlord over mold issues (advocated for my needs) then had to turn around and move back into my old place (good look keeping that available HP). I got behind on all my school work and endured some serious exhaustion with all the moving. It sucked but the worst has passed and I am willing to let that shit go and move the fuck on. 

Drunk me would have stayed in the shitty moldy place, and drank about it. I would have wallowed in self pity about my situation and I likely would have jumped through a bunch of non existent hoops to try and conceive some convoluted plan to fuck over the landlord.

I still have to show up and do the work, but if I do that, things will change with patience, willingness, honest, and service.

My entire life I have had good intentions, but was never able to actually show up, because I was so hungover, and if I did show up and was confronted with something I didn't like, well then ""fuck that"" was my answer. Today I can say that I am active member of AA, supporting fellows trying to heal from addiction; I can show up on time to the foodbank and try to be a helpful team member with an attitude of positive service; I can listen to those with different opinions and not stew in a fit of rage and hate. I can hear others speak and find the similarities instead of latch on to the differences.

I don't do any of these perfectly, and it's a daily practice. The difference is, instead of being in a constant state of self justified anger, that state is way more fleeting. 

Today I get to practice AA principals, not just for the benefits of sobriety, but for actions that are the smallest-tiniest next right thing in dismantling complex, unjust systems. Not for the gram, not for the karma, but because I seek to share and be of service, my life no longer revolves around making sure I have more than enough for me. 

Love yall, hope you are staying sober and staying safe.",68,0

Since the suggestion made by ‚ÄúThe Grapevine‚Äù in the late 60‚Äôs that ‚ÄúOpen Discussion‚Äù (OD) meetings might be a good idea, there has been a change in the message being presented in the rooms from a focus on the Program of Alcoholics Anonymous to ‚Äúgroup therapy‚Äù where anyone and everyone is privileged to speak on whatever might be on their mind. The result of this has been a severe decline in the success rate of alcoholics finding lasting recovery.

We hear a lot of stuff said in meetings that can‚Äôt be reconciled with the program as described in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Here is a list of the opinions, perspectives, and slogans we often hear in rooms and what the our original Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous basic text (4th Edition) has to say about it.

‚ÄúThis program is caught not taught‚Äù

Page xiii Paragraph 1: ‚ÄúTo show other alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main purpose of this book.‚Äù

‚ÄúEasy does it!‚Äù

Page 59 Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúHalf measures availed us nothing.‚Äù

Page 84 Paragraph 3: ‚ÄúWe vigorously commenced this way of living, as we cleaned up the past.‚Äù

Page 58 Paragraph 1: ‚Äú‚Ä¶a manner of living which requires rigorous honesty.‚Äù

Page 58 Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúIf you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any lengths to get it‚Äìthen you are ready to take certain steps.‚Äù

Page 58 Paragraph 3: ‚ÄúWe thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe gift of sobriety.‚Äù

Page 14, Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúSimple, but not easy; a price had to be paid. It meant the destruction of self-centeredness.‚Äù

‚ÄúI choose not to drink today‚Äù

Page 24 Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúThe fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure, have lost the power of choice in drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlay the tape all the way through‚Äù

Page 24, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúThe almost certain consequences that follow taking even a glass of beer do not crowd into the mind to deter us. I f these thoughts do occur, they are hazy and readily supplanted with the old threadbare idea that this time we shall handle ourselves like other people. There is a complete failure of the kind of defense that keeps one from putting his hand on a hot stove.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink through the drink‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúRemember When‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúRemember your last drunk‚Äù

Page 43, paragraph 4: ‚ÄúOnce more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink. Except in a few rare cases, neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must come from a Higher Power.‚Äù

Page 24, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúWe are unable at certain times to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will always be recovering, never recovered.‚Äù

Title Page: ‚ÄúALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS. The Story of How Many Thousands of Men and Women Have Recovered from Alcoholism‚Äù

Page 20, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúDoubtless you are curious to discover how and why, in face of expert opinion to the contrary, we have recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body.

Foreword to the First Edition: ‚ÄúWe, of Alcoholics Anonymous, are more than one hundred men and women who have recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body.‚Äù

Page 29, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúFurther on, clear-cut directions are given showing how we recovered.‚Äù

Page 132, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúWe have recovered, and have been given the power to help others.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are all just an arms length away from a drink‚Äù

Page 84, paragraph 4, ‚ÄúAnd we have ceased fighting anything or anyone ‚Äì even alcohol. For by this time sanity will have returned. We will seldom be interested in liquor. If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and normally, and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality ‚Äì safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have an alcohol problem, I have a living problem‚Äù

Page xxiv, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúIn our belief, any picture of the alcoholic which leaves out this physical factor is incomplete.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling pretty crappy. I need a meeting.‚Äù

Page 15, Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúI was not too well at the time, and was plagued with waves of self-pity and resentment. This sometimes nearly drove me back to drink, but I soon found that when all other measures failed, working with another alcoholic would save the day. Many times I have gone to my old hospital in despair. On talking to a man there, I would be amazingly lifted up and set on my feet. It is a design for living that works in rough going.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink and go to meetings.‚Äù

Page 34, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúMany of us felt we had plenty of character. There was a tremendous urge to cease forever. Yet we found it impossible. This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know it‚Äìthis utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the wish.‚Äù

Page 34, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúWhether such a person can quit upon a nonspiritual basis depends upon the extent to which he has already lost the power to choose whether he will drink or not.‚Äù

Page 17, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúUnlike the feelings of the ship‚Äôs passengers, however, our joy in escape from disaster does not subside as we go our individual ways. The feeling of having shared in a common peril is one element in the powerful cement which binds us. But that in itself would never have held us together as we are now joined.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a selfish program‚Äù

Page 20, paragraph 1: ‚ÄúOur very lives, as ex-problem drinkers depend upon our constant thought of others and how we may help meet their needs.‚Äù

Page 97, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúHelping others is the foundation stone of your recovery. A kindly act once in a while isn‚Äôt enough. You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need be. It may mean the loss of many nights‚Äô sleep, great interference with your pleasures, interruptions to your business. It may mean sharing your money and your home, counseling frantic wives and relatives, innumerable trips to police courts, sanitariums, hospitals, jails and asylums. Your telephone may jangle at any time of the day or night. ‚Äù

Page 14-15: ‚ÄúFor if an alcoholic failed to perfect and enlarge his spiritual life through work and self-sacrifice for others, he could not survive the certain trials and low spots ahead.‚Äù

Page 62, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúSelfishness, self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our troubles‚Äù

Page 62, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúSo our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making. They arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though he usually doesn‚Äôt think so. Above everything, we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kill us!‚Äù

‚ÄúMeeting makers make it‚Äù

Page 59, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúHere are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm powerless over people, places and things‚Äù

Page 132, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúWe have recovered, and have been given the power to help others.‚Äù

Page 122, paragraph 3: ‚Äù Years of living with an alcoholic is almost sure to make any wife or child neurotic. ‚Äù

Page 82, paragraph 4: ‚ÄúThe alcoholic is like a tornado roaring his way through the lives of others. Hearts are broken. Sweet relationships are dead. Affections have been uprooted. Selfish and inconsiderate habits have kept the home in turmoil. We feel a man is unthinking when he says that sobriety is enough.‚Äù

Page 89, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúYou can help when no one else can. You can secure their confidence when others fail.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the right place‚Äù

Page 20-21: ‚ÄúThen we have a certain type of hard drinker. He may have the habit badly enough to gradually impair him physically and mentally. It may cause him to die a few years before his time. If a sufficiently strong reason ‚Äì ill health, falling in love, change of environment, or the warning of a doctor ‚Äì becomes operative, this man can also stop or moderate, although he may find it difficult and troublesome and may even need medical attention.‚Äù

Page 31, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúIf anyone who is showing inability to control his drinking can do the right-about-face and drink like a gentleman, our hats are off to him.‚Äù

Page 31-32: ‚ÄúWe do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself. Step over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try it more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it. It may be worth a bad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your condition.‚Äù

Page 108-109: ‚ÄúYour husband may be only a heavy drinker. His drinking may be constant or it may be heavy only on certain occasions. Perhaps he spends too much money for liquor. It may be slowing him up mentally and physically, but he does not see it. Sometimes he is a source of embarrassment to you and his friends. He is positive he can handle his liquor, that it does him no harm, that drinking is necessary in his business. He would probably be insulted if he were called an alcoholic. This world is full of people like him. Some will moderate or stop altogether, and some will not. Of those who keep on, a good number will become true alcoholics after a while.‚Äù

Page 92, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúIf you are satisfied that he is a real alcoholic‚Äù

Page 95, paragraph 4: ‚ÄúIf he thinks he can do the job in some other way, or prefers some other spiritual approach, encourage him to follow his own conscience.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf an alcoholic wants to get sober, nothing you say can make him drink.‚Äù

Page 103, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúA spirit of intolerance might repel alcoholics whose lives could have been saved, had it not been for such stupidity. We would not even do the cause of temperate drinking any good, for not one drinker in a thousand likes to be told anything about alcohol by one who hates it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must change playmates, playgrounds, and playthings‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúAvoid people, places and things that you associate with alcohol or drugs‚Äù.

Page 100-101: ‚ÄúAssuming we are spiritually fit, we can do all sorts of things alcoholics are not supposed to do. People have said we must not go where liquor is served; we must not have it in our homes; we must shun friends who drink; we must avoid moving pictures which show drinking scenes; we must not go into bars; our friends must hide their bottles if we go to their houses; we mustn‚Äôt think or be reminded about alcohol at all. Our experience shows that this is not necessarily so. We meet these conditions every day. An alcoholic who cannot meet them, still has an alcoholic mind; there is something the matter with his spiritual status. His only chance for sobriety would be some place like the Greenland Ice Cap, and even there an Eskimo might turn up with a bottle of scotch and ruin everything!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a people pleaser. I need to learn to take care of myself‚Äù

Page 61, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúIs he not really a self-seeker even when trying to be kind?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink, even if your ass falls off.‚Äù

Page 34, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúMany of us felt we had plenty of character. There was a tremendous urge to cease forever. Yet we found it impossible. This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know it‚Äìthis utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the wish.‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had a drink today, so I‚Äôm a complete success today.‚Äù

Page 19, paragraph 1: ‚ÄúThe elimination of drinking is but a beginning. A much more important demonstration of our principles lies before us in our respective homes, occupations and affairs.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my opinion that‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about the Big Book, but this is the way I do it‚Ä¶‚Äù

Page 19, paragraph 1: ‚ÄúWe have concluded to publish an anonymous volume setting forth the problem as we see it. We shall bring to the task our combined experience and knowledge. This should suggest a useful program for anyone concerned with a drinking problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink, no matter what.‚Äù

Page 34, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúMany of us felt we had plenty of character. There was a tremendous urge to cease forever. Yet we found it impossible. This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know it‚Äìthis utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the wish.‚Äù

Page 31, paragraph 4: ‚ÄúWe do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself. Step over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try it more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it. It may be worth a bad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your condition.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to give up planning, it doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù

Page 86, paragraphs 3-4: ‚ÄúOn awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these conditions we can employ our mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought-life will be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives. In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don‚Äôt struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a choice to not drink today.‚Äù

Page 30, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúWe alcoholics are men and women who have lost the ability to control our drinking. We know that no real alcoholic ever recovers control. All of us felt at times that we were regaining control, but such intervals ‚Äì usually brief ‚Äì were inevitably followed by still less control, which led in time to pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization. We are convinced to a man that alcoholics of our type are in the grip of a progressive illness. Over any considerable period we get worse, never better.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf all I do is stay sober today, then it‚Äôs been a good day.‚Äù

Page 82, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúSometimes we hear an alcoholic say that the only thing he needs to do is to keep sober. Certainly he must keep sober, for there will be no home if he doesn‚Äôt. But he is yet a long way from making good to the wife or parents whom for years he has so shockingly treated.‚Äù

Page 82 paragraph 4: ‚ÄúWe feel a man is unthinking when he says sobriety is enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a shrink. You have an alcoholic personality. All you will ever need is in the first 164 pages of the Big Book.‚Äù

Page 133, 2nd paragraph: ‚ÄúBut this does not mean that we disregard human health measures. God has abundantly supplied this world with fine doctors, psychologists, and practitioners of various kinds. Do not hesitate to take your health problems to such persons. Most of them give freely of themselves, that their fellows may enjoy sound minds and bodies. Try to remember that though God has wrought miracles among us, we should never belittle a good doctor or psychiatrist. Their services are often indispensable in treating a newcomer and in following his case afterward.‚Äù

‚ÄúAA is the only way to stay sober.‚Äù

Page 95, paragraph 4: ‚ÄúIf he thinks he can do the job in some other way, or prefers some other spiritual approach, encourage him to follow his own conscience. We have no monopoly on God; we merely have an approach that worked with us.‚Äù

Page 164, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúOur book is meant to be suggestive only. We realize we know only a little.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy sponsor told me that, if in making an amend I would be harmed, I could consider myself as one of the ‚Äòothers‚Äô in Step Nine.‚Äù

Page 79, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúReminding ourselves that we have decided to go to any lengths to find a spiritual experience, we ask that we be given strength and direction to do the right thing, no matter what the personal consequences might be.‚Äù

‚ÄúI need to forgive myself first‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou need to be good to yourself‚Äù

Page 74, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúThe rule is we must be hard on ourself, but always considerate of others.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake what you want and leave the rest‚Äù

Page 17, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúThe tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have discovered a common solution. We have a way out on which we can absolutely agree, and upon which we can join in brotherly and harmonious action. This is the great news this book carries to those who suffer from alcoholism.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour Higher Power can be whatever you want It to be; a door knob, a Dr. Pepper can, a light bulb, just any old thing.‚Äù

Page 59, Step 2: ‚ÄúCame to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.‚Äù (A door knob?)

Page 45: Paragraph: 2: ‚ÄúLack of power, that was our dilemma. We had to find a Power by which we could live, and it had to be a Power greater than ourselves.‚Äù (A Dr. Pepper can?)

Page 25: Paragraph 3: ‚ÄúThe great fact is this, and nothing less: That we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences* which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God‚Äôs universe. The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way that is indeed miraculous. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us that we could never do by ourselves.‚Äù (A light bulb?)

‚ÄúJust do the next right thing‚Äù

Page 86, paragraph 4: ‚ÄúWe may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision.‚Äù

Page 87, paragraph 1: ‚ÄúBeing still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and ideas.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make any major decisions for the first year‚Äù

Page 60, paragraph 4: ‚Äú(a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives. (b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism. (c) That God could and would if He were sought. Being convinced, we were at Step Three, which is that we decided to turn our will and our life over to God as we understood Him.‚Äù

Page 76, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúWhen ready, we say something like this: ‚ÄúMy Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad. I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding. Amen.‚Äù We have then completed Step Seven.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay out of relationships for the first year!‚Äù

Page. 69, paragraph 1: ‚ÄúWe do not want to be the arbiter of anyone‚Äôs sex conduct.‚Äù

Page 69, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúIn meditation, we ask God what we should do about each specific matter. The right answer will come if we want it.‚Äù

Page 69, paragraph 4: ‚ÄúGod alone can judge our sex situation.‚Äù

Page 69-70: ‚ÄúCounsel with other persons is often desirable, but we let God be the final judge.‚Äù

Page 70, Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúWe earnestly pray for the right ideal, for guidance in each questionable situation, for sanity, and for the strength to do the right thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlcohol was my drug of choice‚Äù

Page 24, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúThe fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure, have lost the power of choice in drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep coming back, eventually it will rub off on you‚Äù

Page 64, Paragraph 1: ‚ÄúThough our decision was a vital and crucial step, it could have little permanent effect unless at once followed by a strenuous effort to face, and to be rid of, the things in ourselves which had been blocking us‚Äù

‚ÄúNinety Meetings in Ninety Days‚Äù

Page 15, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúWe meet frequently so that newcomers may find the fellowship they seek.‚Äù

Page 19, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúNone of us makes a sole vocation of this work, nor do we think its effectiveness would be increased if we did.‚Äù

Page 59, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúHere are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery‚Äù

‚ÄúYou only work one step a year‚Äù ‚ÄúTake your time to work the steps‚Äù

Page 569, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúWhat often takes place in a few months can hardly be brought about by himself alone.‚Äù

Page 63, paragraph3: ‚ÄúNext we launched on a course of vigorous action.‚Äù

Page 74, paragraph 2: ‚ÄúIf that is so, this step may be postponed, only, however, if we hold ourselves in complete readiness to go through with it at the first opportunity‚Äù

Page 75, paragraph 3: ‚ÄúReturning home we find a place where we can be quiet for AN HOUR, carefully reviewing what we have done.‚Äù

‚ÄúMake sure to put something good about yourself in your 4th step inventory.‚Äù

Page 64 paragraph 3 ‚ÄúFirst, we searched out the flaws in our make-up which caused our failure.‚Äù

716,5 years today,99,gzzvsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/gzzvsj/5_years_today/,37,1591748307.0,"On my 5th anniversary I find myself thinking about my last drink and how I finally got serious about the program. 

The evening of 6/8/15 started out ordinary enough - I was getting ready to head out of town overnight for work. I had just started a new job that I was really excited about and this was the first assignment I was going on to an executive conference where I was going to do booth duty.

As I had done many times before, I stopped at the liquor store on my way to the highway so I could have a few stiff belts on the road and of course have plenty more when I got there to tie a good one on.

While cruising down the highway at 70+ mph about an hour or so into a 3ish hour drive I blacked out. I managed to get to my hotel in a blackout and continued to drink until I had finished that bottle. I have vague memories of watching the Cleveland Cavaliers playing Golden State in the Finals and of going down to the bar since I had run out of booze but not much else. Even after all this time I have almost no memory of what happened that night. The night was a complete blur that faded to black.

I came to face down on the floor of my hotel room the next morning - extremely hung over with blood on my face, some bruises and a huge knot on my forehead with no idea whatsoever how that happened. I was late for my appointment - what woke me up was repeated text messages from my frantic wife who realized I had once again fallen off the wagon the night before by my erratic behavior and slurred speech. With no idea of where I was (she knew the city but nothing else), what hotel I was in or what would happen to me - (Would I kill myself or someone else by driving drunk? Would I get arrested? Would I get fired from my new job by showing up drunk?) she spent a sleepless night worried sick about how this would all end and what would happen next and was frantically trying to make contact to make sure I was ok.

I made lame excuses to my coworkers for my condition - the bump and bruises were because I had ""slipped in the shower"" and I'm sorry I'm late I ""overslept"" but I'm sure they could smell the alcohol on me and knew I was lying - how could they not? After a tortuously long day in the booth I headed back home to face the music and pick up the pieces once again.

When I got home I made a promise to myself to finally deal with this. I would do what it took to get sober and finally take the 12 steps of AA seriously. What followed was several months of introspection and working with my sponsor - of reviewing my life and how I had gotten to this point; where it all started and what was driving my behavior. It was painful to take an unflinching look at myself and really take an honest assessment of my life, my actions, what I had done wrong, who I had wronged and how I had made decisions but I did this earnestly and to the best of my abilities.

That first year was really hard. I was still traveling for work of course and I was too ashamed to admit to my coworkers that I was an alcoholic so I said nothing but did my best to white knuckle through the cravings and temptation. In my line of work alcohol is a constant presence at parties and events so there was no escaping it but if I didn't want to destroy my life, my marriage, my family and my career I had to find a way to stay sober. There were times when it was hell but each time I made it through without giving in I got a little stronger. It got a little easier and as time went on the cravings grew less intense and less frequent. And life started getting slowly better.

The real turning points were taking Steps 5 and 9 - for any newbies or those not aware of how AA work Step 5 is a full confession of all of my wrongs over the entirety of my life to another person. Step 4 requires a full inventory of this and Step 5 is sharing that inventory with someone else. This requires brutal honesty and I had to confess a lot of things I am not proud of but I did it as honestly as I could. I took this step with my sponsor and it took several hours. I then went home and opened myself to my wife as well - telling her things I had long kept secret out of fear and shame. To my amazement she didn't look at me in disgust or throw me out of the house but instead wrapped her arms around me to tell me how much she loved me.

I have never felt so loved in my entire life.

Step 9 came later where I sat face to face with people I'd wronged and did my best to confess these wrongs and make amends. I dreaded this like a disease and yet each time I did this with the key people in my life my heart got lighter and my life got better.

Now on my 5th anniversary when I look back at where I was and what's happened since I can hardly believe it. Today l have 5 continuous years of sobriety - the last time I could make that statement I was 14 years old when I started using. Since I've gotten sober my life has prospered both personally and professionally. I have so many blessings I can't count them all and I have AA to thank for that.

If you're reading this and are struggling with your own demons be they alcohol, drugs or something else please know there are people like myself who are here to help. If you reach your hand out for help, we will reach back. I am so profoundly grateful to be alive and sober and to have so many blessings and this anniversary means more than I can express.

Although financial recovery is on the way for many of us, we find we cannot place money first.  For us, material well-being always followed spiritual progress; it never preceded.

I started seeing my therapist 6 weeks before I came in to AA. Two weeks later he walked into my homegroup--turned out he 7 years sober at that point (he switched homegroups, professional practice). Like me, he is an artist, so we could connect about art--and art-making and sobriety. For the both of us our artistic practice is a major part of being in good spiritual condition. 

When I moved away from NYC and we kept appointments via FT for the past 3 years. Throughout the month of May, he seemed weird, distant and robotic.

My sponsor told me ""denial is deadly"" and that I should tell him that I couldn't keep seeing him as a therapist. So I did. Via email. It was a painfully inadequate way to end a 6 year relationship--but I didn't want to get into a situation where I was arguing with the disease or having the situation turned around on me. ie ""what is going on with you that you think this...""

It isn't, however, the third anniversary of my involvement in AA. My life in the program only began a few months after I stopped drinking, and I didn't begin working the steps until I was close to a year sober. I often read posts and comments here from people who aren't sure if AA is right for them, so I thought I'd tell my story in case it's of use to anyone.

When I got sober, I knew that I never wanted to drink again. But I had a hard time accepting that I was an alcoholic because I had a clear picture of what that meant ‚Äî someone much worse off than I was. I also felt that saying that I was an alcoholic would be an admission of failure. And most importantly, I knew that AA required a belief in a higher power and, as a staunch atheist, I felt I could never acquire such a belief. I'd actually gone to a meeting a week before I stopped drinking, on the advice of a friend. I felt so uncomfortable that I ran home as soon as it was over and poured myself a shot of Mezcal. Never again, I thought.

I got through my initial weeks and months of sobriety due to the pink cloud effect. I lost about 20 pounds immediately with minimal effort and began sleeping well for the first time since I was a child. My friends were supportive and made sure to make accommodations for me when I hung out with them. I remember being delighted that I could remember everything in my life and that I never had to worry about embarrassing myself.

I felt lonely, though, and wanted to meet people who could understand what I was going through. At the advice of my therapist, a sober woman who was opposed to AA, I began attending a weekly SMART meeting in New York City. I found it therapeutic to sit in a circle and discuss my thoughts for a few minutes, but I made no effort to involve myself in the program or make connections with other members. After one particular meeting, when two of the men there nearly came to blows, I decided I was done with them. I then decided to give AA another shot.

A friend who had been sober six years met me for lunch, and told me that AA meetings were less rigid than I'd thought: There was a huge variety of them in New York, and if I didn't care for one I could simply try another. He spoke for ten minutes or so about his own experience with alcoholism, and I felt a powerful, spiritual connection to him as I listened. This, I later learned, is the essence of AA: one alcoholic talking to another.

He suggested that I try a meeting near my apartment, so I found one that was about a 10 minute walk away. I went once a week but seldom shared and made no effort to connect with any of the other members. I saw the value of the meetings but I was still hesitant to commit to AA. I didn't want it to smother the rest of my life.

Then, fortuitously, I discovered that one of my colleagues was an AA member with around five years' sobriety. He invited me to sit in his office for a half-hour on Friday afternoons just to chat. He talked about his sponsor, his sponsees, the steps, and all the fun he had just hanging out with sober buddies on weekends. I began to feel that this was something I wanted for myself, too. But still, I was hesitant. ""What if AA takes over my whole life?"" I asked him once. ""I've found that it has simply enlarged mine,"" he said.

He began to invite me to various meetings in Brooklyn that he thought I'd like. My meeting attendance soon went from once a week to 2-3 times. I was still too shy to get involved in service or fellowship, but I regarded AA as a warm bath that I was slowly dipping myself into.

One night, after a meditation meeting in my neighborhood, an old-timer asked me who my sponsor was. I said I didn't have one, and that I didn't think I wanted or needed one. ""You can't stay sober just going to meetings,"" she said. ""You need to do the steps."" At first, I was offended by her frankness. But later I decided she was probably right. The problem was, I had no idea how to find a sponsor.

A few weeks later, after I had almost decided to give up, I attended a meeting where a man stood up and delivered a qualification that touched me deeply. At the conclusion of the meeting, I walked up to him and asked him if he would be my sponsor. To my amazement, he said yes. This was two years and two months ago, and I still work with him today.

I'm now what I consider to be a fairly orthodox member of AA. I go to meetings on a near-daily basis, I work the steps, I call my sponsor, and I have a large group of friends and running buddies that I talk to regularly. I have a relationship with a higher power and pray and meditate. I do service. I even have my own sponsee. And today, on my anniversary, I credit AA with turning around my life.

The point of my story is that you don't need to figure out AA right away. You don't have to like everything. You just have to keep going back. Eventually, it works its magic. 

Grateful to be sober today.",65,0

The problem of resolving fear has two aspects.  We shall have to try for all the freedom from fear that is possible for us to attain.  Then we shall need to find both the courage and grace to deal constructively with whatever fears remain.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 61

Most of my decisions were based on fear.  Alcohol made life easier to face, but the time came when alcohol was no longer an alternative to fear.  One of the greatest gifts in A.A. for me has been the courage to take action, which I can do with God's help.  After five years of sobriety I had to deal with a heavy dose of fear.  God put the people in my life to help me do that and, through my working the Twelve Steps, I am becoming the whole person I wish to be and, for that, I am deeply grateful.

One of the most encouraging facts of life is that your weakness can become your greatest asset.  Kites and airplanes rise against the wind.  In climbing up a high mountain, we need the stony crags and rough places to aid us in our climb.  So your weakness can become an asset if you will face it, examine it, and trace it to its origin.  Set it in the very center of your mind.  No weakness, such as drinking, ever turned into an asset until it was first fairly faced.  Am I making my weakness my greatest asset?
 
Meditation
Whenever we seek to worship God, we think of the great universe that God rules over, of creation, of mighty law and order throughout the universe.  Then we feel the awe that precedes worship.  I too must feel awe, feel the desire to worship God in wondering amazement.  My mind is in a box of space and time and it is so made that I cannot conceive of what is beyond space or time, the limitless and the eternal.  But I know that there must be something beyond space and time, and that something must be the limitless and eternal Power behind the universe.  I also know that I can experience that Power in my life.
 
Prayer
I pray that I may accept the limitless and eternal Spirit.  I pray that It may express Itself in my life.

A lot of us in recovery have heard, and been disappointed, by this story. But for those who haven't-- Bill Wilson, the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, asked for a glass of whiskey on his deathbed, and became belligerent when it was not provided him.

For many, this story is a source of great disappointment, a black mark on the legacy of AA and the 12 step system as a whole. I've had people tell me that Bills deathbed behavior genuinely bothers them. And I completely understand-- Bill made it his lifes mission to celebrate sobriety, and then he goes and demands whiskey. That sucks, right? What a shame. It's reminiscent of Helen Shucman cursing ACIM during her final years.

However, as someone who has seen dozens if not hundreds of people die, Bills behavior is not particularly alarming or concerning to me. His unpleasant behavior in his final hours is in no way a reflection of the man himself, nor of the program he founded. I'd wager that anyone in the palliative care field would share similar sentiments, after seeing so many patients regress to childlike and infantile states as their bodies slowly and painfully fail, and the only thing to look forward to is oblivion.

I do not want Bills death to be a source of concern or disappointment for alcoholics in recovery, so I'd like to share a little bit about the dying process.

The reality is that dying sucks, even with the heavy duty meds. It's painful, confusing, and scary. Dying individuals are extremely uncomfortable. They contort and squirm. They are distracted. Mentally, there are often profound, negative changes in personality. The best I can describe it is that people who are dying almost become toddlers again. They say bizarre, angry, incredibly hurtful things, and we often counseled family members about this possibility before they stood by their loved ones deathbed. Watching a beloved grandfather say he had always wanted to molest his granddaughter is not something that is easily understood or processed. Are such outbursts a genuine look at a dying persons deepest, darkest thoughts? I don't really think so. I think they are the result of delirium and the raw, animal suffering that precedes death.

Thus, these outbursts should not really be taken to heart.

Bill asking for whiskey is honestly one of the milder examples of deathbed outbursts in my experience. And, again, given the profound discomfort, suffering, and fear that can accompany the dying process, these outbursts should not be taken seriously. They are not an accurate reflection on Bill or his legacy. Sober, healthy Bill would undoubtedly be horrified by his dying counterparts demands.

Some people do die gracefully. Patients with well developed coping mechanisms usually hold it together alright, especially if they are deeply religious or spiritual. That's my anecdotal take, anyway. And some people are so heavily sedated that they just sleep through the dying process. So there are some exceptions to the pattern of experience I'm discussing. But for many, if not most people-- dying is an ugly, confusing, angry shitshow.

Before I conclude this post, there's a couple of other things I'd like to touch on. First, I very often see this particular response to Bills deathbed story: ""Damn, why didn't they just give him a drink? He's dying anyway, so who cares?"" I usually hear this response from non-alcoholics, but disappointingly, I've heard it from alcoholics too.

Two things: YOU are dying. Right now. Yes, your clock is not actively running out like Bill's, but you could be dead TOMORROW. Or even today! Nobody knows what the future holds. So ""he was dying anyway"" is not a valid excuse, because everybody is dying anyway, just at different speeds. Secondly-- if you feel that Bill should have just been given a drink, I feel sorry for you. Because by you saying that Bill should have been offered a drink of the poison that destroyed his life, you are demonstrating that a small part of you still believes that alcohol has some kind of positive quality. That there's nothing wrong with drinking, it's just your alcoholism that makes it bad. 

This is a subtle but very dangerous perspective. So many people believe that alcohol/drugs is a good thing with bad consequences. ""I had so many good times drinking. If only I had a magic body that didn't build tolerance or experience withdrawals, then I could have drank without an issue. I wish I could just enjoy alcohol like my normal friends."" The mindset that alcohol is ENJOYABLE, but that your addictive personality rendered it unmanageable, so you work the 12 steps to stay clean but wish you could unwind with a beer after work like everyone else-- that is dangerous. A ticking relapse time bomb.

It is more beneficial for recovering alcoholics to view alcohol as a *bad thing* with *bad consequences.* Simply poison. Would you unwind with a nice tall glass of cyanide after a long day at work? Alcohol is the same, it just kills you slower and wrecks your family along the way.

You are, of course, free to disagree with my viewpoint. But I spent a lot of time and mental energy reframing the way I viewed alcohol and drugs, and frankly I would not be sober today if I still thought alcohol was good in moderation for non-alcoholics. It isn't. 

All this leads me to my final point, and one I think is wise for my friends here in AA to consider: there is a high chance that you, and I, in the discomfort and delirium of the dying process, will ask for alcohol. Ensure in your living will or advanced directive that you must not, under any circumstances, be given alcohol. No matter how much you beg or whine or plead. Dying Me may have a different perspective, but Sober Me does not want to tarnish my sobriety or insult the sober life I've worked so hard to build with a deathbed bottle of booze. I applaud Bill's family for resisting his requests, and I feel sorry for anyone who thinks they made the wrong decision, particularly if that person is an alcoholic themselves.

I hope this post has helped those of you who were disappointed in Bills deathbed demands. I know the story really bothers some people.

TLDR: Bill W, co-founder of AA, asked for whiskey on his deathbed. This should not be cause for disappointment because the dying process sucks and people say bizarre and hurtful things that do not accurately reflect on their character.",94,0

The unity, the effectiveness, and even the survival of A.A. will always depend upon our continued willingness to give up some of our personal ambitions and desires for the common safety and welfare.  Just as sacrifice means survival for the individual alcoholic, so does sacrifice mean unity and survival for the group and for A.A.'s entire Fellowship.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 220

I have learned that I must sacrifice some of my personality traits for the good of A.A. and, as a result, I have been rewarded with many gifts.  False pride can be inflated through prestige but, by living Tradition Six, I receive the gift of humility instead.  Cooperation without affiliation is often deceiving.  If I remain unrelated to outside interests, I am free to keep A.A. autonomous.  Then the Fellowship will be here, healthy and strong for generations to come.

A millisecond later I realized what  my unconscious brain had done and my conscious brain gave it a smack! ""Hey! We dont drink anymore"".
Subconscious brain goes"" oh yeah, that's right"" and then went back to chasing butterflies in  a Zen garden.
Stupid brain. 
So yeah. A bit of a slip bit more than that a reminder of the absolute need for diligence as the ""new normal"" settles into place.

There are so many gifts of sobriety that I could list here, but the greatest thing is being able to love myself, and be truly present with my children. When I was drinking I couldn't wait for the day to be over so I could get wasted, or I'd be so hungover I just wanted my kids to go to bed so I could rest.

Quickly into my career I decided to turn my perspective around and try to help the weak, alcoholic, substance users and vulnerable people in the communities I worked  

It was well into my career when ptsd, depression and alcoholism/addiction started taking over my life. 

To be honest I never thought that I had ptsd. In the line of work i was in, you have to put on your game face. Laugh at things that are actually sad. Stay strong no matter the fear you may have. Kids from the streets that I use to play basketball with or buy ice cream for began dying. Be it to substance use or gang life. People I use to have coffee and conversations with were the bodies I was finding when doing welfare checks. PTSD isn‚Äôt for our line of work.  It‚Äôs for soldiers. Or so I thought. 

Whether it was the ptsd or depression that led me to alcoholism-addiction or the other way around. I‚Äôll never know. 

A while ago now I was at a local convenience store in uniform near a community where I was working. 
When I went into the store I saw a homeless man, whom I knew from the community. I used the bank machine and quickly took the 160 dollars out and left the store. 

A few minutes later he was chasing me down the road. I stopped and he asked me how much money I took out. I told him after hesitation. He then asked me to count it. I did and found I was 40 dollars short.   The man held up his two hands with 20 in each and gave me back the money. 

I was astounded that this man who lived in our stairwells, addicted to heroin and fentanyl who had nothing but hustling to make money returned mine. 

I wrote a small blurb about it on Facebook and told him I did. He asked me to tag him so his mom didn‚Äôt think he was such a bad guy. 

About a month goes by and he adds me on Facebook, I tag him, and my messenger on Facebook explodes from his friends and family including his mother who thought he was dead after not hearing from him for two years. 

She flew from Cape Breton to Toronto and began her hunt for her son. She looked all day with no luck then by some miracle, he walked past her on the street and said ‚Äúhey I know you, your my mom‚Äù

She cleaned him up and sent him to a rehab center across the country in Vancouver where he got sober and is still sober over 2 years later. 

Meanwhile I was struggling with my own issues and burning my life to the ground. I found I became addicted to addiction long before I became an addict\alcoholic. 

I was unable to keep myself sober. I tried my hardest. My family and friends couldn‚Äôt help me. No matter how hard I had tried the alcoholism had taken over. I isolated myself from my kids, family and friends. 
I lost almost everything   Finally when I hit my bottom I reached out to the ‚Äúonce upon a time‚Äù homeless man, as well as the people I had met through him including members of the treatment Center. 

They had me there within 2 days. 

I‚Äôm clean and sober today. The fellowship is now a group of my brothers and sisters

ALL PEOPLE are my people

I‚Äôm about 3 weeks into my journey with sobriety which has been pretty up and down depending on which day you ask me. Some of the net gains I have experienced so far have been my lowered blood pressure and better sleep which frankly I didn‚Äôt think was achievable. Anyway my AA big book came in and I decided to crack that bad boy open during my breaks at work. I‚Äôm at  chapter 3 and this has started to get a little too real. Its scary how identical the similarities are, its as if this book was written about me!

*me 30 seconds later: ‚Äúwell no shit dumbass you‚Äôre an alcoholic, of course it describes you!‚Äù* Lol

But seriously, at the beginning of chapter 3 it discusses the desire for alcoholics to be able to tame their drinking and be able to drink ‚Äúnormally‚Äù. This is a belief system that is so damn hard to give up. So hard! Because even now I‚Äôm thinking of years down the road when I get to the point where I have defeated alcohol and can control it as I please. I also think this particular point was so poignant because it unapologetically illustrates how absolute sobriety is. 

This made me put down the book and really search deep inside. If I want to get better then theres no in between. If I wish to commit myself long term then, I‚Äôm either in or I‚Äôm out. This is what I think I need. This is that direct, No BS, tough love that I have cowered away from all of my adult life until now. 

I don‚Äôt have the answers. I don‚Äôt have the cure. What I do have is the desire to go just one more day. Through mindfulness and my higher power, I have faith that those days will multiply. 

Thanks for listening and I wish everyone well on their journey.

Few indeed are the practicing alcoholics who have any idea how irrational they are, or, seeing their irrationality, can bear to face it.  For example, some will be willing to term themselves 'problem drinkers,' but cannot endure the suggestion that they are in fact mentally ill.

They are abetted in this blindness by a world which does not understand the difference between sane drinking and alcoholism.  'Sanity' is defined as 'soundness of mind.'

Yet no alcoholic, soberly analyzing his destructive behavior, whether the destruction fell on the dining-room furniture or his own moral fiber, can claim 'soundness of mind' for himself.

I still suffer from almost crippling social anxiety, but being able to be anonymous in InTheRoom meetings and here on reddit has been enough support for me.  Even if I didn't need to call a sponsor up in the middle of the night in a panic, just knowing these communities were out there and are ready if I needed that panic call, was more than enough to set my mind at ease.

During the last 11 months, I've gotten into shape.  I'm more involved in family life.  I am generally happier and more productive at work.  And I've been able to take some good hard looks into my soul and find the areas that I used to just drown in alcohol.  I've started making amends, both with myself and others.  

I almost had a moment of weakness early on in the pandemic.  I got so overwhelmed. I didn't know how I was going to be trapped at home and how I was going to get through it sober.  But I quickly went back to one of the most important axioms of the program.  One day at a time.  I can do one hour.  One day.  I can do that.  And I did.  And I still am.

Sorry to get wordy.  I just wanted to post my gratitude.  There's no way I could have done it as long as I have without this community.  I know there are still miles to go.  And that's okay.  I can get there.  One day at a time.",30,0

I heard someone suggest dropping the price of a beer into the basket, and I thought, that's too much!  I almost never give one dollar.  Like many others, I rely on the more generous members to finance the Fellowship.  I forget that it takes money to rent the meeting room, buy my milk, sugar and cups.  I will pay, without hesitation, ninety cents for a cup of coffee at a restaurant after the meeting; I always have money for that.  So, how much is my sobriety and my inner peace worth?

Sooo... I‚Äôm a newcomer (39 days) and after 3 or 4 negative conversations with my sponsor, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs normal. 

The first time, her car had broken down so she asked me to pick her up, take her to a meeting and take her grocery shopping then home afterwards. I was excited to get to know her better so I happily obliged. Out of the blue, she claimed I interrupted her and told me it was my self-centeredness caused by untreated alcoholism coming out. All I had done was say ‚Äúyes‚Äù agreeing with her while she was still mid-sentence so that one confused me. 

The second time, I called her because I was having a strong craving and she criticized me for talking about myself instead of asking how she was. (I kind of get that... but I‚Äôm just trying to learn how to not drink and I thought sponsors were there to help?)

The third time I was trying to explain what happened last year when I tried to get sober and how self-will fucked me up.. just trying to talk out mistakes I made then to figure out how not to repeat them.. and she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to stop you. People have gotten sober going through much worse.‚Äù And that was frustrating because I wasn‚Äôt throwing a pity party... I wasn‚Äôt saying I couldn‚Äôt stay sober bc I was going through something rough. I was trying to figure out my mistake and was saying I think that it was relying on self will instead of a HP during a difficult time trying to get her thoughts on that.. but she didn‚Äôt understand that bc she told me to stop talking lol. Then I tried to explain the misunderstanding and she called me argumentative. üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

I just feel like she‚Äôs making assumptions about me without trying to get to know me and it makes me feel misunderstood. Each time something happens, I feel myself clamming up with her more and more because I‚Äôm afraid of dealing with the drama of another misunderstanding. I feel bad about myself and drained most of the time after speaking with her. Is this normal??",27,0

First time poster, I‚Äôm not sure if this is appropriate. I‚Äôm trying to quit, I‚Äôm 20, my dad is an alcoholic and it definitely runs in the family. My brother and I are both aware that we‚Äôre becoming alcoholics. I‚Äôve drank every night since I turned 18. 

Every morning I wake up and want to drink immediately. Something about the burn in the stomach from stealing a mouthful of gin from my parents‚Äô fridge. Maybe it‚Äôs about the theft as well, and being secretly drunk. 

I‚Äôve been fighting this urge with decent success for a couple of weeks now, I slipped once, but mostly I can go through my day without drinking anything. 

But then, I try to sleep. I‚Äôm sure everyone here has heard this a million times, and I‚Äôm sure everyone reading this is thinking ‚Äúyeah duh kid, we all had trouble sleeping, you don‚Äôt know the half‚Äù. I know, I‚Äôm lucky, I‚Äôm so lucky, but... closing my eyes is terrifying and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Being sober makes my experience of existing more vivid, and when I close my eyes at night, I see bright, BRIGHT lights. An absolute sea of shifting rainbows and check patterns and waves and it freaks me out so much. I can‚Äôt let go of what I‚Äôm seeing, it doesn‚Äôt dissolve into blackness at all, it looks like a shifting ocean of horror and I get scared. I go downstairs and drink, and then I‚Äôm less freaked out by the back of my eyelids, and less able to question why there‚Äôs rainbow colours here - (colour is already v weird to me, apparently atoms in the eye emit light at different frequencies, that freaks me out). 

Every night I make a tea with special sleepy teabags, read in bed, then try to sleep, and every night a voice just says ‚Äúdrinking will fix this, it will let you sleep‚Äù and I keep giving in. 

A second fear is the vividness of dreams when there‚Äôs not much alcohol in my system. When I was really trying to cut down a couple months ago, my dreams got MAD vivid and clear, they had music, voices, and I remembered them fully. It was horrible, it made me question what was reality and what wasn‚Äôt. 

Does anyone have any advice or stories about going through something like this? Shifting shapes in the dark being bright rainbows? Dreams being a scary prospect? Please, if anyone has any good advice about how to get to sleep sober, I‚Äôd really really appreciate it. Sorry again, I know this isn‚Äôt the most pressing problem.

Edit: I‚Äôm crying like a blubby mess as I type this, it‚Äôs a release, a happy cry, a relief, thank you all so much for responding to this, I felt so in the wrong writing this post, and I‚Äôve felt so scared. All your responses about how much better life is sober and how common these problems are have been extremely comforting, and the supportive tone of everybody‚Äôs comments has, as I‚Äôve already said, brought me to tears. Thank you for all being so kind, thank you for the love, I‚Äôve never experienced anything like this. ‚ù§Ô∏è",23,0

I have earned with my pain the right to this year and many more. I cannot tell you all how much work this was. I have faced life ending criminal charges. The kind that make you a social pariah. I had no prospects. My plan was to struggle to live while using and hopefully die. My family had made peace that I would die and so did I. I thought I would never be able to stay sober and clean.

In this past year I got a homegroup after OD'ing twice in one day, and a trip to the psych ward. I couldn't face life using and I couldn't bear not to. It was either kill myself or get clean.

This homegroup member became my sponsor. I worked the steps, I faced the difficult things in my life like no job, no money, probation, therapy, broken relationships with this sponsor. I grimaced and told myself that if I couldn't stay sober these things would get worse and worse. Absolutely nothing good would come from my life if I couldn't just get sober. Then I decided whatever happens after being sober is what I'll take, because it'll be a gift. I wasn't expecting much. I expected to just live somewhat isolated and quietly.

That did not happen. I started to thrive.

I got a job, and am getting a new job. I have a nice apartment with a nice girl. I am in college at age 28. I am a brother to my brother and a son to my parents. I can look myself in the eye. I do not forget the past but it will never define who I am today. 

I will never trade this today for my awful yesterdays.

I am also going skydiving so thats cool too.

I am a sponsor to guys. I love to show them that there is hope.

I actually didn't drink...But I FUCKING SHOT UP, with IV Dilaudid, three days in a row.  Now 5 days sober.

Even crazier, I never once used IV drugs before this week, at most I would double-up on percocets from the dentist but just never got into opiates and never injected IV drugs.

I started a new career in nursing last year, and I work the night shift an hour away from where I used to live, so I am totally disconnected from the people I used to rely on.  I am awake at night and sleep during the day to maintain my work life. I guess I didn't realize how bad the weight of my job is, until I literally had a needle in my arm.

As a nurse, and terrified to be found out.  I never endangered patients or swiped meds that were supposed to go to patients, and I never used drugs at work or worked high.  Never.  But obviously I got the dilaudid from work and brought it home.  Kinda a big deal.

This whole internet/Zoom-only form of meetings scares the absolute shit out of me.  I can't feel anonymous online, and I can't lose my nursing license over this. On top of that I'm ashamed to confess to people I know in AA since I have been MIA most of this year.  I can't even tell my boyfriend, who has been by my side and is just a wonderful person who doesn't deserve to be lied to.  He knows I have been taking xanax prescribed to me and that I'm struggling with that, I have a script for 1.5 mg a day for about 5 months now.  I'm too ashamed to speak.  Reddit is the first place I am even typing this, under a throwaway.

But AA, I struggle there too.  The program, even when I was going daily, has always had a big cringe-factor in my mind.  I'm an atheist and I don't know that it will ever change.  My HP was ""love"", and that got me through the first couple years, but I just never really felt at home in AA with god, speaking in unison, biblical passages.  It's stupid but it never sat right with me even on my best days, I'm not here to disparage the program and there are things I LOVE about it but I have a lot of hurdles too.

I already know what you'll say: Go to a meeting.  I know. I am just so ashamed, so scared, and I can't tell a soul.  Zoom just scares me so much, the internet is indelible.

Anyway obviously I don't know wtf I'm doing.  Please help.",58,0

I knew when I turned 18 and started seeing irreversible side effects happening that I needed to stop before they got worse and do something with my life. Some of you know that I hitchhiked the country when I was 19. As it truly was the best experience of my life so far, it was one of the worse as well. I almost got murdered 4 times in that 6 month period, and my drug usage was at its all-time peak, I'll spare the details. Being at the bottom of society during that time gave me a premium perspective of life. I found myself and I found God, at the lowest totem pole of life. I set goals and got inspired to do something for myself. I saw what the rest of my life could be if I didn't put down the needle and pipes. I got into meditation when I was 17 and really heavy when I was cross country. It has given me the rich spirituality I live with today and has helped me overcome life when it gets lower than I want to admit. Relapse after relapse, failure after failure, I finally got a year clean. In the past year of being clean, I have started 2 businesses and have set goals for my life I'm working towards that I couldn't fathom coming true while I was an addict. I've had to cut so many people out of my life that influenced me to be the opposite of who I want to be and the potential I know I hold. On the flip, I respect the people who haven't influenced me over the years after I decided I needed to better myself. If you're struggling, reach out, to me, a friend, a loved one, a higher power, or even your higher self through meditation. You can overcome addiction in any form. BUT you have to want it for yourself. The last thing you need to hear is someone telling you ""you need help"" and the first thing you need to hear is you telling yourself ""I'm ready."" I didn't think I would be where i am at this early in life, granted I still have a long way to go on my journey, but I wouldn't be this far if I was still using. If you're still trying to ""figure out life"" try doing it sober. I didn't even attempt to set goals while I was using it. I look at myself now, and I'm finally starting to know what pride feels like. As far as the addiction I struggle with, I take it one day at a time. Moving forward in life, I'm ready to be the best version I can be.",13,0

Hey everyone I‚Äôm new to sobriety, 38 days, and If there‚Äôs anyone in the same boat as I am or skeptical about going to an AA meeting then I‚Äôll share with you what I can about my first experience without revealing too much.

So I posted about a month ago when I first quit drinking that I was going to attend my first AA meeting that next day and well that didn‚Äôt exactly go as planned. I drove all the way to the church, about 25 mins away from my house, sat in the parking lot and watched everyone greet each other and file inside. After they all went in I put my car in drive and I drove my ass away. I said nope I‚Äôm not doing this. The fear took over me and it took about a month to build up enough courage to go back and try again. I finally walked through the doors of that church last night and I was floored by what I had witnessed! Now the first person I sat next too was quite grumpy but I still greeted him with a smile and went about my business. What took me aback was everyone else who greeted me like I was a family member they hadn‚Äôt seen in forever. I literally had to question their enthusiasm to meet me like ‚Äúuhh do I know you?‚Äù The speaker spoke after everyone took their seats and as his words began resonate with my personal experience, I slowly began to feel my ego melt away. All my preconceived expectations and fears were proven to be false. I was at ease. After the meeting was over, I briefly spoke to a few members, thanked the speaker and then I headed home.

When I drove away I swear I couldn‚Äôt help but to smile from ear to ear. I was filled with a joy that I haven‚Äôt felt in a really, really long time. Best of all, this was an organic joy that came from within and had the effect on me that nothing external could give me. I felt accepted. I felt wanted. I felt loved. For the entire drive home it felt okay to be me and that is all I ever wanted. I‚Äôm starting to get teary eyed as I write this so I‚Äôll close with this. If there‚Äôs anyone who is new and needs that little boost to get you going or is afraid to take that first step then its ok. I was too. But when you do you‚Äôll feel that much better.

God Bless

I have repeatedly demonstrated that alcohol makes everything about who I am worse. When there is rage, it enflames me. When there's sorrow, I am inconsolable. Never before have I laid hands on someone, until last night. 
Some friends had come over to my first house to help my wife and I move in. We shared pizza and alcohol of an at this point unknown kind. Things were fine until I started to binge drink. Neither I nor my friends know how many drinks I had before I let out my inner jackass. One very dear friend called my wife a bitch, in jest, and I slapped her for it. 
I don't really remember very much besides being upset and confused as to what had happened. Before now, I hadn't really thought much about needing to examine my relationship with alcohol, but it is very apparent that a break at the very least is needed. I've been seeing a counselor for a couple months and Tuesday is my next appointment. I'm going to make it known that I need help and that this is not the way I want to live my life. 
As someone who has only just realized a problem, it would be very helpful to hear from others who have been in a similar place. As they say ""The best advice comes from those who have walked the path you are on.""

I'm a new mother, have a 4.5 month old baby and since breastfeeding didn't work out after a couple of months of trying extremely hard, I started abusing alcohol.

 I think I used it as an escape because there were other things going wrong also, I didn't feel like we had a family as my partner didn't bond much with baby and just continued on with his life of working late then staying up even later drinking and gaming and then sleeping right up till his shift next day. We never do cute family things, and we have no family photos yet. I'm really disappointed with how it has all panned out.

 My triggers are seeing my two cousins on facebook with their new babies in happy family photos with their partners, their partners getting really involved and doing nice activities, it all looks so nice. I feel like a single parent. So yes that's when I decide to have too much alcohol, and last night was particularly bad and resulted in a big fight with my partner. I vomited up this morning. I really hate myself right now and have contemplated suicide. He might be moving out, he hasn't told me yet. 

It doesn't help that alcohol is so accessable in our house, my partner brews spirits and always has 20L bottles of it ageing with rum/whisky chips.

I hope this message gives some hope to those in early days. It can be done. Even by the most gnarly,  grizzled, hopeless drunk.

Do what you gotta do to keep at it.

939,8 days sober alcoholic,13,idnlvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/idnlvo/8_days_sober_alcoholic/,20,1597974215.0,"I am 40, started drinking at 14. I have been trying to quit for years, and get it in my head that I have to stop, usually when I am plastered. I send messages to my wife saying I know what i'm doing to you and i'm going to quit, etc... After waking up after a drunk 9 days ago, I read a message from my wife saying she can't do it, she won't let our daughter live like this, she's leaving town for a bit to do some school shopping (we live in a rural area), I need to take this time to get help. She also said that she wanted to move to a different town. She has been reading an alanon book my mom gave her, it's been sitting on her bedside table for months. You would think that would have been a clue eh? I have been drunk for so long that I was not there for her when she needed me. She has shut me out. Now I am sober and completely devastated, the situation I have created without knowing.     


I took her suggestion. I found help. I have been attending daily zoom meetings, and have had so much support from an uncle who has been in the program for years with great success. I am SO excited to live a sober life, and I am 100% ready to do the steps because my uncle says it works, and he's a smart dude! I'm having a tough time finding a local sponsor, both local meetings have been cancelled, I waited there and nobody came. I need to get going on this as I know I cannot quit on my own, I have tried.  


Ah the reason for my post. My wife and daughter are coming home tomorrow, and she casually texts me if I had a plan for where I was going to live when they got home. I was blindsided by her comment, tried to keep my cool and just turned the phone off. The past few nights we have been talking about recovery and really opening up, and now today she has completely 180'd. Instantly, the serenity I had been feeling turned to anger and combativeness. Here I thought I was going to show her what a kind, thoughtful sober husband and father I could be (like I used to be), we can work on the steps together it's going to be just wonderful. I'll go on picnics without beer, go on bike rides, visit friends, all that shit I found boring without a drink. But she wants space. Now i'm trying to decide whether to pack my shit right now and go live in a tent or tell her i'm not leaving. It's not a good situation.    


I don't want to be selfish, but me moving out will certainly retard my progress and in all likelihood result in her moving away as she hates the house that I have been drunkenly renovating these past 4 years. I just can't wrap my head around not living with my family. I'm sure this distancing she wants is an alanon thing, i'm trying hard NOT to check the alanon forums again as I don't want to inadvertently manipulate her with my alcoholic brain. Also, that forum is a scary depressing place, I feel like a huge bag of shit.  


I know there's hope for me and also my marriage, I feel gutted that my wife wont let me try. I don't know what i'll get out of this post, I had to tell a room full of strangers because I really don't know who else to turn to right now. If anyone of you have one of those feel good aa quotes now would be the time for posting.

I had a few drinks Tuesday and ended up smashing the front panel of my car into the garage door frame.

Wednesday, I threw out my ""secret stash"" in a public dumpster where I couldn't go back if I changed my mind. Even though one box of wine was almost full. Threw it out, and drove off.

Today I had to go into the grocery store. I normally do drive up so I'm not tempted because if I am in the store, I WILL come out with alcohol. I had to go in to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday. The bakery dept. is right next to the alcohol. Any time in the past, I would have slid right on over and come out with more wine. Today from the minute I got out of the car til I got back in with cake in hand, I kept repeating the serenity prayer in my head like a mantra. In and out, and another day down.

945,(UNPOPULAR OPINION) I don't think the lord's prayer should be used in meetings,77,if57rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/if57rl/unpopular_opinion_i_dont_think_the_lords_prayer/,117,1598196853.0,"""Our Father in heaven, hallowed  be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts,  as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation,  but deliver us from evil""

With how the big book describes a higher power \*as you understand it\* it's odd to me that they do this specific religious prayer from the bible at the end. The program seems to contradict itself in this regard. A third of the world is christian, so what about those other 2/3 of people who have an addiction with different beliefs?

I had a meeting yesterday and it was incredibly awkward to be the only person sitting down while they read that prayer. It's an isolating and excluding feeling. Then you got people who get heated for voicing your opinion on the matter and it creates conflict. Not the kind of safe, inclusive, and welcoming atmosphere that I think is necessary for people with this disease. I just learned of some different meetings in my area that don't do that prayer, so I'll be checking out those.

What's your opinion on the matter?

Edit: Thanks for all the responses! I read every one. It's a relief that I'm not the only one who's bothered by this. Here's my take on some common arguments/opinions 

1. It's tradition! Respect the program's origins and bow your head and think of your own thing   
\- I think we should prioritize making the program as welcoming to everyone as possible, because that would help the most people, and I'm sure that's what the founders of this program would have wanted. Remember that many people have been wounded by religion; abusive parents, bad church, etc. It's not easy for someone like me to listen to that. It can be a trigger. 
2. Bring it up in your AA meeting. Group conscious will decide. Go to another group.   
\- Fair enough! I just wish there was a more convenient way to know if a group does this religious prayer before attending and having to listen to it. 
3. I take my own meaning from the prayer. I revise it to fit my way of thinking.   
\- That's great. I think that's a very humble and patient thing to do. The thing is, many people are wounded by religion and get triggered by it. It's extremely difficult for me to join in a christian prayer and see the value and similarities between my way of thinking. I'm sure I can build that skill over time as I work through my trauma, but I think that isn't something that should be put on newcomers or people who don't yet have that kind of patience and humility. 
4. It's 20 seconds. Get over it!  
\- I could say the same. ""You can't practice your religion for the duration of the meeting. Get over it.""

I was always pretty successful even when I was drinking (in some ways, it is actually what allowed me to be okay with certain things), but everyone started drifting away.. because 5pm would hit, and then it was no use talking too me until the next day.

Friendships have been regained, people call me now if they have an issue. Not the other way around, and I feel better than ever.  The craziest (but also most liberating part) is that I actually make less money now, then when I was drinking. I‚Äôm not willing to do things that are maybe outside the bounds, or are a grey area anymore.

I have one focus, and that is my daughter first, girlfriend (who has put up with more shit over the years, that can be imagined), and being happy with myself.

One of the best comments I have heard in the past 3 days, was that I was working alongside probably 6 other guys. The head of our company walked in, and looked at everyone to say ‚Äúno drinking on the job‚Äù. Then in front of everyone, he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worried about you, you always get it done right.‚Äù Then he pulled me aside (I‚Äôve worked for his company for about 5 years, far from the most experienced), and said ‚ÄúI know what you have gone through, I am an alcoholic as well, over the past year you have shown me you are capable of being the general manager of this company‚Äù.)

My mother refused to speak to me and no friend would answer my calls. I had been to AA in the past telling myself I tried but it just didn‚Äôt work for me.

 It wasn‚Äôt until I had finally given myself to the program, surrounded myself with men who pushed me to be better, and got a sponsor who took me through the book and the steps at a pretty quick pace did I finally start to grasp and comprehend a manner of living that was infinitely better than the way I was living.

I don't feel that I have self-control sometimes, when I just let loose, and it's difficult for me to stop. Usually I end up rationalizing why I should just let myself drink, which was about a few times a week, but now only one special occasions. I've been attempting to not drink at all, even on holidays and things like that, as I don't like stopping. 

Normally, I'm on the introverted and quiet side, and when I drink, I become social and enjoy myself more. The last time I let completely loose, I woke up on my apartment floor with no memory of how I got there, and limited myself to two shots of whiskey last time I drank. I haven't had a drink in 6 months, and sometimes, I just get these cravings whenever I pass by the alcohol sections in grocery stores. 

They're bearable and I resist picking up a bottle of liquor, yet I want to stay 100% sober. One of my parents is an alcoholic and I've feared becoming an alcoholic since I'd been off and on attempting to drink in moderation before, mostly giving up hope that I can. 

I don't know if I'm an alcoholic or not, and felt like a total fraud at a few AA meetings I'd been to earlier this year.

To spend too much time on any one alcoholic is to deny some other an opportunity to live and be happy.  One of our Fellowship failed entirely with his first half-dozen prospects.  He often says that if he had continued to work on them, he might have deprived many others, who have since recovered, of their chance.

We feel a man is unthinking when he says sobriety is enough.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 82

When I reflect on Step Nine, I see that physical sobriety must be enough for me.  I need to remember the hopelessness I felt before I found sobriety, and how I was willing to go to any lengths for it.  Physical sobriety is not enough for those around me, however, since I must see that God's gift is used to build a new life for my family and loved ones.  Just as importantly, I must be available to help others who want the A.A. way of life.  I ask God to help me share the gift of sobriety so that its benefits may be shown to those I know and love.

When I hung up the phone, I remember thinking, well I guess I will drink as much as I can since I will have to quit soon. She arrived to find me very drunk and in danger of myself, the neighbors encouraged her to call the cops. The cops came and took me to the hospital on a psych hold. I was released the next day, and the Dr suggested I check out AA.

Fast forward to today, which is 3 years later...I will pick up a 2 year chip in October. I've made a lot of my amends, but I never did the real deal with my Mom...she was always so involved and supportive of me, it's not that I felt like I didn't need to, I just hadn't.

Today I got to give an amends, a real deal talk with my Mom about what happened. I found out what it looked like her from her point of view - like, I didn't know the neighbors had come out to help her. I got to tell her that so much of the reason I am able to stay sober is because I don't want to lose any more time having a strained relationship with my family. That if even just one drink would un-do any of the magic that has returned to our relationship, it could never be worth it.

When I came into the program, all my relationships were in tatters. Today, I am a grateful daughter, sister, friend, co-worker...moments like these reinforce my faith, reinforce my commitment to staying sober. If you are new and you were here because you are feeling disconnected to your loved ones, I super suggest working the steps of AA and giving it a good chance.

My partner has a friend who had a bad day and asked if he could go get drunk with him at his house and I'd stop by for an hour or so later and then take him home.  Surprisingly, I feel absolutely no desire to partake in the drinking, nor do I feel it will change when I arrive. 

My liver has healed itself from some damage that had been done due to my excessive drinking. I'm also now battling kidney cysts in my right kidney that I have to have annual checkups on to ensure they don't turn cancerous.

Given that I just recently passed my 6 years anniversary I thought I'd share the part of my journey that involves my higher power and I hope that perhaps it can help others that are seeking or struggling to find their God/Higher Power.

I was 50 when I went to rehab back in September of 2014 at what was a pretty low bottom.  No job for over a year.  A marriage that was in shambles and my two teenage kids wanted nothing to do from me.  I had no real purpose and was so addicted to alcohol that I had to drink all day just to keep the withdrawals at bay - I'm talking a fifth of bourbon a day and sometimes more.

My parents raised me with no concept of a god or higher power.  My dad was a WWII vet and served in the German Luftwaffe, fought on the Russian front before eventually be captured by the US Army.  He questioned the existence of because if there was one, how could he let all the death and destruction happen?   I became that person that felt smarter that those that believed in some pretend entity to help them get through life, however looking back at my life I did have some spiritual experiences but when they happened I just didn't recognize them for what they where.

When I got to rehab I was faced with this God/Higher Power concept and this time I simply decided to stop telling myself there wasn't one.  I didn't have a concept of a higher power but I know *I just stopped convincing myself there wasn't one*.  About 6 weeks later I am out of rehab and I am working the steps with my sponsor and we get to Step 2 in which he asks me to create my vision of a higher power and describe it's attributes. I hung up the phone and thought about it for a few minutes and a vision of a wide calm river came to mind and my higher power was caring, understanding, honest and forgiving.  When I would think of my higher power I would visualize myself being on the river bank and when I wanted to tap into it I would visualize myself being in that river just floating along and going wherever it was going.  There was however still a figurative and literal distance between me and my higher power because it was I was on the river bank just watching it go by.  I've come to find out I am hardly the first person to visualize God/Higher Power that way.

My sponsor liked my visualization but also added that I would know when I am connected to my higher power when I acted like I described it.  That for me was the turning point because now I realized that when I did the right things and acted the right way I had proof that God was working through me at that moment.

As time went I began to visualize me being in the river more and more instead of just watching it go by.

My sponsor from the very beginning suggested I get on my knees every morning and every evening and pray.  Instead, I would do it laying in bed before I went to sleep then again when I woke up.  I did this most days but I could never muster the will to get on my knees.  Then one day I was in a meeting when someone shared that they too couldn't get on their knees until they realized it was their ego that prevented them from doing so.  Man, that hit home and I knew he was describing me.  There was no way I could escape that my ego was literally and figuratively separating me from my Higher Power.  That was about 18 months into the program and I started getting on my knees almost every morning and every night.  I have to admit at first it felt awkward but eventually it became a lot easier and more comforting.

Fast forward to about 3 years in the program and since then I am on my knees every night before I go to bed and I roll out of bed right onto my knees.  I no longer visualize my Higher Power/God (I used them interchangeably) as a two dimensional river but rather an omnipresent power that is everywhere. - it's in me, in front of my, near me and frankly every where.  When I act selfishly I can't help but admit that is my own will and when I act like my God would want me to act it is because he is present in me at that moment.

The challenge now is to keep my higher power/God in me at all times.  I admit I am not there yet and it may never be, but that concept provides me with the guidance I need throughout the day and my life.

My sponsor was right when we first started working together . . . he said ""your concept of a higher power will change over time"" and he was absolutely correct.

Thanks for read and I hope this helps someone.",13,0

I was in a mental state that truly scares me when I think back on it.  I woke up one year ago, still drunk from the night before, full of regret like so many times prior, and I knew I was going to lose my wife and die from alcohol poisoning if I didn't make a drastic change.

My wife convinced me to find a meeting and it was a really incredible experience. I have pretty intense anxiety and depression so it was really rough forcing myself to go in there, but when I got my white chip and everyone cheered for me and I got a big hug, it really helped me feel more welcome and gave me the courage to share a little.

I now take proper medication for my depression instead of trying to self medicate with alcohol, sought therapy outside of AA, and have been rebuilding relationships from years back. I really can't believe it's been a year and I have so many people I'm thankful for that so selflessly offered a hand or just someone to talk.

It's been a long year, it's almost been like learning to walk again when it comes to understanding my emotions and keeping a healthy mental state, but I've never felt more at peace. I feel human :)

I drank last night. I was feeling insecure, anxious, hopeless & overwhelmed with responsibilities. I was at the gym for group exercise. I couldn't stand seeing the person in the mirror. I walked out half way through the class and went straight to the liquor store. I bought 6 beers and told myself that is all. Not even through the 5th beer, I ordered an uber. Bought a 12 pack. Ended up drinking Eleven beers before blacking out. 

I  am at a fork in my life. One way leads is me in a success & happiness. One that has me finishing college. Finding an occupation that is enjoyable. Gaining admiration and respect from my fellow peers. Finding love and hopefully having a family. The other is a slow deteriorating death.

I got a call this morning from a fellow who was in an amusing bind. About a week ago, he'd dropped off his clothes as a laundromat in Brooklyn. The next day, after he picked his bag up and came home, he found that he'd accidentally been given someone else's clothes. Their bags, I guess, were identical.

He brought these clothes back to the laundry place and asked the manager to find his; but they weren't there. Several days passed. Still, no clothes. Worse, the laundromat workers spoke almost no English ‚Äî just Chinese.

My friend knows two people in Brooklyn AA who speak Chinese. One didn't pick up the phone. The other was me. Would I go with him to the laundromat and talk to the managers? It might not make a difference, but it'd mean a lot to him if I did. 

I wasn't wild about this request. Seemed like an annoying errand. But I agreed. A half-hour later, my friend called back and said they'd found his clothes after all. 

The lesson? For my friend, reaching out and asking for help yields results. And for me, saying yes to service does the same.",15,0

I've been going into a bar every now and then to play the slot machines. I always went during the day and drinking never even entered my mind. 
    Tonight I was bored and decided I'd go throw fifty in the slots. I went in  and went straight to the slots like I always did. The bar had a decent crowd so there was plenty of people drinking but my back was to them and I was in a adjacent room. The music was loud and I could hear all the people enjoying themselves. Together it was just to much and I could just feel my resolve melting away. I got up, cashed out and left. 
    Walking down the street all I could think about was going back and sitting at the bar and ordering a drink. It was like a rubber band trying to pull me back. I mean at that point there's was nothing more I wanted than to go sit among those people and just drink until I thought I was happy like those people did. I just kept walking until I got home, went inside and locked the door. Even now I just want to go back. 
   How could I have been so stupid. I thought I was stronger, that I had this thing licked. I thought those time I walked into those empty bars and didn't even think about drinking proved that I could go and do it any time. I was wrong!!!

(29m)  I have been an addict my entire life. I have a nasty chuckle to myself  when i remember going to ""the beer store"" with my grandfather as a kid. I  love my grandfather and that was my favorite trip. I had my first drink  at 13. It was a bottle of sambuca my mother got as a christmas gift.  But as most of you may know. It's sometimes difficult to get alcohol at  that young of an age. So by 14 it was weed and ciggarettes. by 16 it was  adderal and percocets. by the time i was 18 I was a full blown IV  heroin addict. I thought i was going to die then. More than once i was  slapped awake by my girlfriend. After a failed trip to rehab and a whole  lot of patience from my family and girlfriend. And a lengthy trip to my  fathers. I was able to stop and stop for good. I am 8 years clean of  heroin. The problem lay in the fact that I had made myself a promise  before stopping. When i turned 21 i would switch to alcohol. ""alcohol  cant kill you just by accident it takes a long time"" i thought ""its  safer"" i thought. so the very first day i returned from my fathers i  bought a handle of tequila. and i learned to drink it right from the  bottle. any time i wanted to use i grabbed that bottle. that was 8 years  ago.  it became a habit that i have been told by doctors will kill me  before i ever see 40. I have been drinking a gallon of vodka a day for  the past three years. It has destroyed my life and my relationships. I  have been arrested multiple times. I have been homeless multiple times.  and i finally decided to stop. Im posting here because im just looking  for some encouragement, as you can imagine there are no people left in  my life almost at all. and the few that are are tired of hearing my  excuses. I started a month into covid. i made 1 month sober. and then  drank and ended up in protective custody that day. another week of a  gallon a day and i decided to try again. and this has been the pattern  for the past 6 months. I get so far and then an oppurtunity presents  itself and i cant say no. and everytime when its over on top of the  shame i genuinely feel close to death. i have high blood pressure  throwing up all day shaking and sweating and feeling like ill pass out.  and im afraid if i do pass out i wont wake up. I cant afford rehab i  cant afford a therapist. Im just reaching out for someone to share or  give words of wisdom for someone in my specific position.

I have what from what ive seen and read even from alcoholics a really bad drinking problem. Looking for advice.

I have no recollection of what happened. Today was a huge challenge. I was faced with circumstances that would normally bring me to drink. My cousin came from out of town and asked to spend the day with me on short notice. I cleaned the whole house. It was a mess; I can't remember the last time I've cleaned sober. When she came over with her boyfriend, she mentioned a few times that we could get drinks. I told my partner it was completely okay to get some beer for them. Then I said I was tired, so I was going to make some coffee. I thought it would be so awkward, but no one thought anything of it! Later that night we promised we'd go to my uncles birthday party, where EVERYONE was drinking, but I didn't have a single drop. I can't remember the last time I've been around my family sober. Most of my drinking was done in secret, such as drinking from a water bottle full of vodka in the bathroom to get a head start.

Had I not crawled into a zoom meeting on my hands and knees three weeks ago, none of this would have happened. I probably would've gotten trashed tonight. But I found a sponsor after my first meeting and have talked to her every day since. When I told her about these events, she helped me prepare and reminded me that it was okay to say no. I'm so glad I got through today and could actually be present for my family. I'm going to try to treat my recovery like my career right now. Sometimes I start to worry about falling off the pink cloud, but I'm trying not to waste mental energy on things I have no control over. Just wanted to share this with someone. My husband is the only person who knows about my recovery aside from AA. Not sure when or if I should tell anyone, I'm honestly too ashamed right now. I'm 24 and I've spent the past 3 years spiraling into chaos. It's time for me to start growing up, and that will never happen if I keep drinking.",31,0

I'm told the next day that I said and did things I don't remember, even though I'm not initially aware of holes in my memory. I become brutally honest and verbally cruel. I planned my wife's birthday with my nine-year-old stepson and remembered literally NONE of it after I woke up the next day, to his frustration and mystification. Most recently, I found myself trying to sneak shots of tequila since there was only one beer left.

I've resolved to stop before. I had homebrewing equipment that I threw completely into the garbage on one morning of regret. I've tried to ""cut back.""

Just as the Twelve Steps of A.A. are written in a specific sequence for a reason, so it is with the Twelve Traditions.  The First Step and the First Tradition attempt to instill in me enough humility to allow me a chance at survival.  Together they are the basic foundation upon which the Steps and Traditions that follow are built.  It is a process of ego deflation which allows me to grow as an individual through the Steps, and as a contributing member of a group through the Traditions.  Full acceptance of the First Tradition allows me to set aside personal ambitions, fears and anger when they are in conflict with the common good, thus permitting me to work with others for our mutual survival.  Without Tradition One I stand little chance of maintaining the unity required to work with others effectively, and I also stand to lose the remaining Traditions, the Fellowship, and my life.

I do think that my mother in law is an alcoholic, opens first bottle of wine around 3 and does not stop most nights that I have been around.  

I just have a hard time seeing why I used to drink like that.  Of course I never did well in a group setting.  Having to talk and shut like that.  No I drank at home alone and didn't want anyone to see what I was doing.   I would rather sit at home alone with netflix in drinking than ever have to talk about feeling and crap like that.

My life is truly better for having put down the bottle and realizing what I was doing to my immediate family.  My wife and my kids have a better life now because I am present and not drinking.  

As I said I will be 1 year in this Tuesday, and am thrilled to be this far in my road to recovery.  1 day at a time as we always say. ‚àÜ change is a uphill road, but a good one to be on.  

For all the new people here and in the rooms, when you are in a new situation, know your sober plan ( I will drink la croix, if things get tough I am leaving the room, or going to the bathroom, or going home for the night). Also there is an end to the night.  (I have learned that it's ok to say goodnight, and head home)

I'm not sure when it was recorded but it's timeless. It's called ""Joe & Charlie 'Big Book Comes Alive'"" and it's made up of 10 hour and 15 minute sessions recorded over the course of a weekend seminar, I believe. It's 2 old alcoholics sharing a ton of amazing information about the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, how it was written, and how it can be used in your life and recovery. 

I've learned so much! I listen to it every night as I go to sleep. I just celebrated a year sober. Even with the help of an amazing sponsor have been stuck on the 4th step for months. Listening to this has completely transformed my understanding of this, and every other step. I'm now making great progress and am almost done with step 4. 

I highly recommend this to anyone in AA, no matter how much time you have or how well you know the Big Book. It's incredibly humorous as well. I hope you enjoy it and get as much from it as I have.

We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The last Promise in the Big Book came true for me on the very first day of sobriety.  God kept me sober that day, and on every other day I allowed Him to operate in my life.  He gives me the strength, courage and guidance to meet my responsibilities in life so that I am then able to reach out and help others stay sober and grow.  He manifests within me, making me a channel of His word, thought and deed. He works with my inner self, while I produce in the outer world, for He will not do for me what I can do for myself.  I must be willing to do His work, so that He can function through me successfully.

This isn‚Äôt something that happened to me by just going to meetings. This came to me by getting a sponsor who has worked the steps, and doing what he suggested I do. I was thorough in my fourth step. My sponsor and I did it together sharing all my resentments with him. I ask my higher power to remove the things that are blocking me from being useful to my fellows. And you know what happened? They were removed.

A man came to the meeting drunk, interrupted the speakers, stood up and took his shirt off, staggered loudly back and forth for coffee, demanded to talk, and eventually called the group's secretary an unquotable name and walked out.  I was glad he was there ‚Äì once again I saw what I had been like.  But I also saw what I still am, and what I still could be.  I don't have to be drunk to want to be the exception and the center of attention.  I have often felt abused and responded abusively when I was simply being treated as a garden variety human being.  The more the man tried to insist he was different, the more I realized that he and I were exactly alike.

Early in my A.A. life, I became employed in its services and I found the explanation of our society's logo to be very appropriate.  First, a circle of love and service with a well-balanced triangle inside, the base of which represents our Recovery through the Twelve Steps.  Then the other two sides, representing Unity and Service, respectively.  The three sides of the triangle are equal.  As I grew in A.A. I soon identified myself with this symbol.  I am the circle, and the sides of the triangle represent three aspects of my personality: physical, emotional sanity, and spirituality, the latter forming the symbol's base.  Taken together, all three aspects of my personality translate into a sober and happy life.

Setting boundaries after AA member lies,18,j2nwr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/j2nwr4/advice_needed_setting_boundaries_after_aa_member/,18,1601478532.0,"Hi there! I (38F) met a woman (35F) at a meeting several weeks ago. She's new, we exchanged numbers, chatted about kids, and discovered that we live very near each other. She cannot drive right now so I offered to give her a ride to the outdoor meeting I attend. A couple weeks went by when she texted out of the blue that she needed a ride to the drugstore and that it was an emergency. I picked her up and gave her a ride to the drugstore and we made plans to get coffee the next day.  
  
The next day at coffee, she said she was going to pop into the convenience store nearby before we headed home. Whatever. We made plans to attend the outdoor meeting the day after.  
  
When I picked her up for that meeting, she AGAIN asked to stop by the store since it was on her way. This time it finally seemed weird enough that I paid attention to what she brought out--iced tea, cheetos, and cigarettes. I know she and her young daughter live with her parents, so I figured she was smoking on the sly.  
  
Fast forward to last night when her *mom* messages me on Facebook saying that her daughter was drunk and out of control, could I please call her and talk her down. When I called, her mom informed me that I can't take her to the store because she was probably buying alcohol. Of course. She's a 35 year old adult woman and I'm not a babysitter, but I'm also not going to aid in her relapses.  
  
I talked to the woman and she settled down to the point where she wasn't screaming ""Fucking bitch, you're a god damn liar"" at her mother. Whatever booze she has was poured out (by her parents) and she has agreed that drinking wasn't a helpful response to the stress she was experiencing earlier. I'm going to pick her up and we're going to the outdoor meeting tonight.  
  
Here's where I need advice--she hasn't acknowledged that she was buying alcohol at the store. I've told her that I'm not a taxi and can only take her to and from meetings from this point forward. She was fine with that. Are there other boundaries that would be helpful to set? I have discussed this with my sponsor very briefly and will be having a longer conversation when my sponsor is done with work, but the conversations with the new girl will happen before that.  
  
I recognize that I should have trusted my gut and not agreed to take her to the store when I first started to get a weird feeling about it. I also recognize that I'm not responsible for her relapse(s). I'm a little weirded out by her mom contacting me to ""get her under control"" but I guess her family is grasping at straws. I want to be the hand of AA, but I also don't want to enable her. I can't want her sobriety more than she wants her sobriety.  
  
So, basically, I'm just looking for guidance regarding the next conversation I have with this woman. I've not yet been in a situation like this. My usual support people are all occupied at the moment, so I'm reaching out to you all!",18,0

**What's your analysis of the following comment?**

""As a brain scientist let me just say that most brain scientists don't know shit about alcoholism or addiction. They look at it from a strictly pharmacological perspective, seeing dependence and tolerance strictly in terms of receptor half-lives binding constants.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor\_(biochemistry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry))

Yes, that plays a role, but it is actually a very minor part of recovery. Alcoholism is a thinking disorder whose major symptom is drinking. As long as drinking is maintained, then thinking cannot change. But remove alcohol, and underlying problems are exposed and can now be addressed. Early on I was discussing serenity prayer with my sponsor, and I asked what ""wisdom"" was, and he replied that it was "" ability to recognize a mistake as we are making it again."" What sobriety makes possible is opportunity to do things differently. We still make mistakes, but we start to stop them earlier in process.

Our alcoholic behavior is really just a set of established reflexes that respond to cues, so a big part of recovery is identifying those cues and then choosing a different pathway to avoid them. In recovery we have two opposing forces. bad one is biochemical and behavioral draw of alcohol and ""alcohol lifestyle."" To counter this we first remove alcohol, and then we alter lifestyle (not forever, but for at least as long as alcohol has its cunning, baffling, and powerful influence over our thinking processes) to one which is better. thing is, THIS is a daunting task. When we first look upon challenges ahead, we see them as being too great, and a return to bottle is just way easier and less painful. If we drank to reduce anxiety, this becomes really frustrating because anxiety is likely to go off scale when we stop drinking. But it does get better, and this is why I tell those new in recovery to be patient. Give it some time. challenge though becomes easier when we break it down into smaller units, which is point that these and all of other researchers seem to miss. We don't need to get completely better overnight. We can get just a little better each day, and slowly over time those days begin to add up.

I liken alcoholics to cats. bottle is our can opener, and we all know how long it takes a cat to stop reacting to can opener. We also know that second we give cat some food after using can opener, entire behavioral extinction process starts over on day 1. So it is with us drunks. We have these deeply ingrained synaptic pathways that have been reinforced daily for years. Unfortunately it takes a long time for them to disappear (or at least lose their strength) through disuse. This process can, however, be sped up a bit by simultaneously replacing them with new behaviors or activities. wisdom of AA is that pretty much every strategy to do this has been tried and tested. For those who started to drink right after work, solution was often going straight to a meeting and not to bar. We all have needs that need to be met, and one of those is companionship. If we go home rather than bar, we have removed alcohol from equation, but at same time we have also lost our source for companionship. Successful recovery doesn't come just from removing alcohol, it comes from replacing alcohol with a better strategy to fulfill need that alcohol was providing. So a meeting acts to provide companionship but in an alcohol-free environment. And it is hard to think about drinking if you are distracted by actually doing something else.

If alcohol is removed, physical pathology will likely reverse over same time course because for most part it is simply a biochemical process. That is what scientists are measuring. What ODAT approach gives, though, is a means by which one can maintain motivation to keep going. AA doesn't say go to 90 meetings, it suggests 90 meetings in 90 days. Going to 90 meetings in 10 days doesn't provide that much more benefit. It is 90 days that matters, and staying motivated to do 90 days. Probably half of posts here are about problems with motivation to keep going. So listen to those with time who say it is worth effort, because they are proof that it can be overcome. Stopping drinking is actually easy. But stopping drinking and not going bat-shit nutz is a bigger challenge. All of scientists, and most of doctors, that I have worked with over years see addiction problem purely as a pharmacological model. What they are looking at, though, is really de-tox problem. Once receptors have been stabilized back to baseline, which is rarely more than 30 days max, depending on regeneration half-life, their contribution is over. That 28 day treatment model isn't just a coincidental number. But those of us in recovery know that 30 days is just beginning of interesting part, where thinking needs to change.""

I still have many of my deeply ingrained character flaws, some of which include insecurity, low self esteem, codependency and abandonment issues.

This girl I've been seeing is a normie. She doesn't really understand my situation and the things I've gone through in my life that brought me here.

Somehow I've scared her away today with my inability to be confident at all times. I wear my heart on my sleeve sometimes by becoming quiet when I feel hurt or sad.

I don't know how to just let things be and roll off my back and not affect me emotionally. I feel like I can't help it if I really care about someone and want them in my life.

Anyway, my being like this has scared her away. She went from being an amazing friend and lover to not even talking to me in literally a day. I feel abandoned, rejected and unlovable.

All that being said, I have this deep urge to make these feelings go away the easiest way I know how to. By getting drunk and high. I know it's the wrong way and I know it'll only make things worse and my time will start over.

I have lurked Reddit for a long time, and decided to make an account only so I can post on sober subreddits and hopefully be of service somehow! When I need to get out of my own head but I only have a moment to spare, I think it might be nice to open up this app and spread some encouragement here. I thought it would be better to introduce myself first before I start randomly commenting!

Step 10 says:

Continue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear. When these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them. We discuss them with someone immediately and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone. *Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help.* Love and tolerance of others is our code.

I would drink wine every night for about 5 yrs. A bottle or more a night, I would by the little Sutter homes 4 pack bottles because they have 13% alcohol in them sometimes more.Every night
About 2 years in to my drinking is when my anxiety started and 3 months ago my health anxiety got so bad I decided I needed to quit because I‚Äôm scared of the long term effects my drinking may have. So I have some questions.., 
1.When can I stop worrying about quitting cold turkey? I read it‚Äôs not safe and you can die I never had withdrawals not any shakes or anything.but I‚Äôm scared now 
2.Ladies*** did sobriety effect your period in any way? Mines been weird since quitting 
3.When did your anxiety stop after sobriety? I know everyone is different. I have started seeing a therapist.. I refused medication for it I want to heal naturally.

To be honest,  every day passed 24 hours is a day I didn‚Äôt think I could be sober.  I‚Äôm super proud I‚Äôve endured this pandemic sober.  I was sad when I was near the 1 year mark.  I kept looking at my story and I didn‚Äôt have the things that people talk about in meetings within the year.  I didn‚Äôt have a 6 figure job, I didn‚Äôt have my credit cards paid off, we are still renting our home.  I was really feeling sad.

That night I was lying in bed reading the news and I started getting new breaks that there was a shooting in on the Strip.   I immediately got out of bed.  I was simultaneously getting dressed, going pee, and connecting with strangers on the internet.  My husband said ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù  Me:  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôve got to help.‚Äù  A woman posted on Facebook that she had 6 friends stuck near the airport who were at the concert and there were no cabs or a way for them to safely get out of there.

The day 1 took my 1 year token I had taken donations and food to a hospital where the victims families where at.  None of those things I could have done if I were drinking.  I was able to be of service because I was sober.   Today,  I did my grandma‚Äôs grocery shopping since she is in an assisted living home and can‚Äôt leave because of Covid.

Being fair-minded and tolerant is a goal toward which I must work daily.  I ask God, as I understand Him, to help me to be loving and tolerant to my loved ones, and to those with whom I am in close contact.  I ask for guidance to curb my speech when I am agitated, and I take a moment to reflect on the emotional upheaval my words may cause, not only to someone else, but also to myself.  Prayer, meditation and inventories are the key to sound thinking and positive action for me.

Continue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear.  When these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them.  We discuss them with someone immediately and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone.  Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The immediate admission of wrong thoughts or actions is a tough task for most human beings, but for recovering alcoholics like me it is difficult because of my propensity toward ego, fear and pride.  The freedom the A.A. program offers me becomes more abundant when, through unremitting inventories of myself, I admit, acknowledge and accept responsibility for my wrong-doing.  It is possible then for me to grow into a deeper and better understanding of humility.  My willingness to admit when the fault is mine facilitates the progression of my growth and helps me to become more understanding and helpful to others.

I had been in AA for over a year and I kept relapsing. My last relapse started Labor Day (Sept 6) and very quickly I found myself drinking every single day, morning noon and night, like nothing had changed, even tho I had garnered a fair amount of sober time. I was calling rehabs and finding prices, I was seeing a therapist, I was one step away from signing onto an outpatient program. I remember feeling a fear that I haven't felt before, fear that I was never going to get better.

Something about AA though, I saw all my friends in the program getting better and staying sober. Also, I won't lie, I am cheap and was like, AA is free and I'll just spend ALL my time in AA until it works. And, most importantly, I will work the steps with full vigor, no more half measures. And essentially that's what I did. I went to 2-3 meetings a day for several months, I got a sponsor and I did NOT let go, no matter how much I kind of hated her in the beginning. 

I had to do my best to give up all the my old ideas about myself, and with my heart, try to live as an honest, kind, compassionate person. Stopping drinking was the goal, but what I found was a new life where I am happy and I truly love myself and those around me.

I don't work full time so I was told that I could keep filling them out until I hit 40 hours in a week. Even if I was over I was filling them out. My husband said that they are getting so many people committing fraud that they are going through every one's file. I just feel like a complete looser. I have worked threw the covid, didn't quit my job like most people did just to collect the extra money. I was the only employee that showed up. I am beyond stressed out that I feel sick. Just don't know how to handle it without getting shit faced. But I am going to hang in there and stay sober tonight. Thanks for letting me rant.",11,0

I've been in the programme for just over 8 months, and it's really changing my life. So happy to answer any questions or just chat if you're having a bad day!

Take care

This is not an overnight matter.  It should continue for our lifetime.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

During my early years in A.A. I saw Step Ten as a suggestion that I periodically look at my behavior and reactions.  If there was something wrong, I should admit it; if an apology was necessary, I should give one.  After a few years of sobriety I felt I should undertake a self-examination more frequently.  Not until several more years of sobriety had elapsed did I realize the full meaning of Step Ten, and the word 'continued.'  'Continued' does not mean occasionally, or frequently.  It means throughout each day.

I was in such a horrible spot that the only thing I could manage was ""help"", not even out loud because I couldn't speak. Just ""help"".

Defeated, and knowing it, I arrived at the doors of A.A., alone and afraid of the unknown.  A power outside of myself had picked me up off my bed, guided me to the phone book, then to the bus stop, and through the doors of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Once inside A.A. I experienced a sense of being loved and accepted, something I had not felt since early childhood.  May I never lose the sense of wonder I experienced on that first evening with A.A., the greatest event of my entire life.

The concept of God was one that I struggled with during my early years of sobriety.  The images that came to me, conjured from my past, were heavy with fear, rejection and condemnation.  Then I heard my friend Ed's image of a Higher Power: As a boy he had been allowed a litter of puppies, provided that he assume responsibility for their care.  Each morning he would find the unavoidable 'byproducts' of the puppies on the kitchen floor.  Despite frustration, Ed said he couldn't get angry because 'that's the nature of puppies.'  Ed felt that God viewed our defects and shortcomings with a similar understanding and warmth.  I've often found solace from my personal confusion in Ed's calming concept of God.

He had been a drinker since high school but been pretty intense for about 4/5 years. Before that it was just occasional or at parties.

I have no issue with drinking on weekends or even having a beer or 2 after work every day. 
My issue comes from a couple different areas. He drinks nearly every single day. Its not an exaggeration. The only time he doesn't is when he is trying to prove to himself that he doesn't need to drink. Which I appreciate a lot! 
Its also how much he drinks. At least a 6 pack and a pint every night. Im not expert but that seems like so much, especially compared to what he used to drink.
He already has high blood pressure and high cholesterol and im worried sick about what its doing to him. The doctors keep telling him he needs to stop or drink less but he just brushes it off. He also is a smoker. About a pack a day

Financially it is killing us. He spends between 500-800 every month on booze and cigarettes. Our overall income is only about 2100 a month with a mortgage of 600+
We also have a daughter that is less than 2.

I just dont know what to do anymore. We have talked about it numerous times before. Usually he is the one bringing it up. I've tried every method I can come up with. From.thr looks supportive all the way to the hard headed harsh reality option. But nothing works. 
So now I mostly just keep it to myself and occasionally try to encourage him to take a few days off or drink less this night or whatever. 
But anytime I say anything, it doesn't matter how I say it. He gets upset and screams about how he already hates himself enough as it is.
It breaks my heart and I just dont know how to help. I've suggested AA or seeing a therapist but he is VERY against it.

What can I do?? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",15,0

I‚Äôve been sober since july now and  today I started writing down some moronic situations I‚Äôve gotten myself into during the years while drinking myself into a ditch and I feel like sharing some insanity with you! 

- Partied all night and got to the first day of uni straight from the club and still very very drunk. 
- Got home from the club with my friend, decided I needed ciggies so I left to buy some but ended up in a bar and slept in a strangers closet. (It was...interesting)
- Drunkenly called my mom to argue with her and telling her off for calling me an alcoholic. She heard I was drunk of course. 
- Got lost in my own apartment building because I forgot which floor I lived. 
- Almost sat my bed on fire while smoking because I was to drunk to go outside. 
- Got lost in the woods for several hours while looking for a rave.
- Picking fights with everyone and then apologized the next day, only for it to happen again and again. 
- Went to the ER and traumatized a family next bed by having a drunk panic attack about the dude in the bed. He was fine, I just got it in my head that he was on the brink of death. 
- drank alone at home, woke up with the vague memory that I had invited someone home and that someone had been there during the night, still have no idea who that person was. 
- Fell into winter water and almost drowned. 
- Had my friend call my work pretending to be hospital staff because I was to hungover to make it into work. 
- banned from my favorite bar after causing all kinds of havoc. 
- ordered pizza, forgot I ordered pizza so I ordered again. Forgot. Ordered again. Woke up with three pizzas in the bed, sauce all over me. 
- Threw up on a security guard and was escorted without grace off the premises. 
- Smuggled some liquor into a club, put it in my leggings, I forgot about it and smashed the whole bottle. 
- Went into the drunk tank and recognized a girl who worked there. I know I knew her but I can‚Äôt for my life remember who it was and that haunts me still. 

The list just keeps going. I can laugh at some of these situations but I‚Äôm mostly grateful that I‚Äôm done with that life. I was never the fun crazy party girl, I was a miserable alcoholic with zero real social skills. Today I‚Äôm still an alcoholic but at least a sober and a happier one.",35,0

The booze fairy told me that was good enough and I could definitely drink sensibly now and stop at one or two. Yeah okay. At the end of August, when that 31st day struck, I began to slide back into my habits. I was ""okay"" for the first week, until my girlfriend got COVID and my work quarantined me for almost 30 days. I had nothing to do, no where to go, and the binge started. It continued up until the 29th of September. I woke up that morning and decided I needed real help. Going to the hospital for a few librium just wasn't going to work this time. Not that it ever really ""worked"" in the past. It was always a short lived promise to myself that this was the last time. How quickly I forgot that promise every single time. I made a phone call to a substance abuse facility in California and 13 hours, two flights, and a car ride later I was there.

1178,Celebrating 10-years of sobriety! I am thankful for everyday I‚Äôve been free of the bottle. As long as you win the day you will win the war. I promise you it gets better.,112,jjehzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/jjehzi/celebrating_10years_of_sobriety_i_am_thankful_for/,35,1603848065.0,"Ten years ago today (10/28/10), I was pulled over and arrested for a DUI. The officer showed me my BAC was at .205, almost three times the legal limit. After this happened, I decided to temporarily quit drinking with every intention of picking it back up once things settled down. 

I received 15 days in jail (Tent City, Thanks, Arpaio), $18,652.45 in fines and legal fees, one year with an ignition interlock device, and 36 hours of court-ordered drug and alcohol counseling that I was to pay for at $89 per hour. 

At first I resented my time in recovery, but eventually, I was compelled to face my reasons for drinking. This realization led me down a long dark road, but ultimately, I found the light at the end of the tunnel. This view drove me down the road to recovery introducing me to a life of sobriety.

Once sober, I faced an uphill battle in placing the broken pieces of my life back together. After many false starts and broken hearts, I finally gained traction when I decided to return to school and pursue a P.h.D. in Clinical Psychology.

When I first announced my plans, people remarked I was too old to go back to school, that because of my record I would not get far with my graduate applications. Many cautioned me that I should play it safe, get a job, get married, and live an ‚Äúordinary‚Äù life.

It has now been ten years since I became sober and without a single relapse. I am currently attending a top-ranked clinical P.h.D. program on a prestigious fellowship researching alcohol addiction, with the hopes of helping those with the same problem as me to live better lives.

I do not say all of this to brag and boast about how great I am. I say all of this to show how lost I was, and how I was still able to find my way back. I say all of this to encourage those of you struggling with addiction that help is available, and there is life after addiction. I say all of this to let those of you who think it is too late to make a change in your life, that there is still time to achieve your dreams.

The most pernicious lie ever told is ‚Äúdo what you love, and you will never work a day in your life,‚Äù this is false. Love is hard, work is hard, and working towards what you love in life is hard. However, it is an entirely worthwhile endeavor. 

I challenge all of you reading this to work towards improving yourself continually, to pursue your dreams fervently, and to never let a person set limits on your potential in life.",112,0

I‚Äôm reaching out to see if anyone needs any help or advice,

I‚Äôm 29 now and have been in the program over 14 months. Coming in at 28 y/o I thought I was too young....

After 16 years of heavy drinking and drugs, making mistakes, violence, embarrassment, harassment and generally being a shit guy after a few beers it was time (advised alcohol might be the problem by my physiatrist)drinking came to an end.

Not long after coming to AA I realised that all my pain, feelings and thoughts had been echoed around the rooms for years by thousands/millions of others before me.

Now I have a good idea of who I really am and a better idea of who I‚Äôm not. Peeling back the layers and getting to know me has been amazing and I‚Äôm wanting to share that with others.

If there is anyone new to the program and wants some help just drop me a message.

Best of luck to those still out there and anyone struggling,

Stay strong and keep coming back

It wasn‚Äôt like my prior relapses, where I convinced myself that I could drink like a normie again. I didn‚Äôt notice a crack in the dam, there were no warning signs. What was my trigger? My wife and mother put me in the middle of an argument between them, and I was so consumed with stress & anxiety that I went to our pantry and downed four beers that we kept on hand for company. I didn‚Äôt even think before doing it. I just did it. The reason it has taken me so long to post this (I just told my wife and sponsor yesterday) is because the moments after drinking I didn‚Äôt feel any release, all I felt was shame. That immense shame that I hadn‚Äôt felt since I got sober last year. Luckily I had no desire to continue drinking after those four beers, and am still kicking myself for so impulsively falling off the wagon. Since I didn‚Äôt continue drinking I considered keeping this slip to myself, but my conscience got the best of me and I knew it would eat me alive if I didn‚Äôt come clean. 

So here I am, back on day 12 and grateful that after this relapse my wife didn‚Äôt leave me and I have the group power of AA to get me back on track and stay sober. This disease is cunning, baffling, and powerful.

It was just another day. Kids went to school, I sat home and worked. I even had forgotten that today was the day. I'd been looking forward to it kind of, like I was expecting something to feel better or different somehow. But it wasn't. My girlfriend was getting into bed tonight and I stopped in my tracks on the way to the bathroom.

""Shit!""

""What?""

""It was my sobriety birthday today. I didn't even do anything.""

""Aw. Well, congratulations baby ""

""...thanks, I guess...""

She didn't know me until I'd been over a year sober. She doesn't care for drinking, but there's a bottle of wine in the fridge. I never think about it. I doubt she does either. She'd never touch it in front of me, though I'd never ask her not to.

But I don't think about it.

It's too important.

Three years ago today, I walked outside my office building and puked up blood. I was newly divorced, the proud custodial father of three kids: 2, 7, and 8. Their mom lives a hundred miles away. 

I was barely holding it together. The divorce and preceding years had taken a hell of a toll on me. I'd get a six pack every day after work, and see how many I could get down on the way to daycare to retrieve the youngest. I'd make sure to get out for the second before it was too obvious to the clerks at the gas stations. It was probably always obvious.

Of course, I'd struggled for years, at least ten. I had a weakness for cheap beer and cheap vodka, and a passion for metered day drinking. You might think it ruined the marriage, but truly I leaned on it to keep me from leaving. Sure it made us all miserable, but I was resigned to misery regardless.

Anyway, three years ago today, staring at the bright red blood streaking the bricks, I made up my mind to find my local chapter. I was the only one there without a paper to put in the basket for a signature. The people there were...
 
Normal.

Just a bunch of regular people that slipped. Slipped and slid, tumbled and rolled through some of the worst life had to offer, over months, years, decades. They all had stories to tell: arrests, DUI, alienation, injury, hospital stays. I had none of those stories. I didn't feel like I deserved to be there. I had earned their fates time and again, but the universe had smiled upon me while it emptied their bowels on them. 

They'd been thrown in jail as I coasted blithely and drunkenly past cruisers on the highway. They'd lost their whole families while I'd gotten custody of my kids. They'd gone broke while I'd scraped by. They'd hit rock bottom. I never really had.

I never took a sponsor. I never did the steps. I never gave myself to a higher power. I even refused to admit I was powerless.

At first.

But slowly, I kept going back, kept listening, kept not drinking. I collected my shiny coins and carried them in my pocket and clinked them around like a little kid with a secret he wants people to know but doesn't want to tell. I'd read out loud from the book and put my money in the basket and make small talk. But I never belonged.

It's not that I wasn't powerless. It's not that there was no higher power. It's not that the steps don't work. I just still had too much good in my life, I think. I had a supportive older brother for a housemate. I had my wonderful kids, and a job where I was well liked and treated with decency. I had enough money to pay the bills and some left after that too. And all these people at these meetings had lost all those things. They had pushed them away, given them up to the drink. 

This, in some twisted way, was their gift to me. They'd been where I was headed, and come back without any good stories. At least with none to tell in meetings. I knew I hadn't been where they had, but nobody ever plans to go there. Nobody who's been there ever plans to go back, until the day they do. 

And this post, meandering and pointless though it may seem, is really dedicated to those people. 

To all of you.

All of you who go into meetings, just trying to hold out for one more day. Those of you who follow the tradition of service, and those of you who don't. Every one of you who speaks of their past and present, sharing stories and trembling with guilt and sorrow; telling the rest of us how bad it got.

Thank you.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Nobody in that room ever really knew me, but they changed my life. When you bare your soul, fidgeting and staring into your styrofoam cup with a quarter inch of coffee in it, you might be telling the story that turns someone's life around. They may never tell you, and you may never see them again, but seeing you in all your boring normalcy sharing the mundane horrors of alcoholism could just be the sliver of reality that helps someone get there.

You didn't help me because you were special. You helped me because you were just another regular person, just like me, who proved that the fight - though it may never be won - can be managed and held at bay. 

My mom passed away just a few months ago. Her alcoholism tore our family apart when I was ten. She died in her recliner, alone, with empty cans of Miller High Life on the table and a lit Pall Mall in the ashtray. She was 63. We still don't really know how she died, but it wasn't Covid.

Thank you for helping me believe I can fight that future. Thank you for showing me there's no shame in admitting to weakness, and that strength comes from resisting. 

I couldn't have done it without you.

Happy birthday to me.",70,0

Never since it began has Alcoholics Anonymous been divided by a major controversial issue.  Nor has our Fellowship ever publicly taken sides on any question in an embattled world.  This, however, has been no earned virtue.  It could almost be said that we were born with it... 'So long as we don't argue these matters privately, it's a cinch we never shall publicly.'

Do I remember that I have a right to my opinion but that others don't have to share it?  That's the spirit of 'Live and Let Live.'  The Serenity Prayer reminds me, with God's help, to 'Accept the things I cannot change.'  Am I still trying to change others?  When it comes to 'Courage to change the things I can,' do I remember that my opinions are mine, and yours are yours?  Am I still afraid to be me? When it comes to 'Wisdom to know the difference,' do I remember that my opinions come from my experience?  If I have a know-it-all attitude, aren't I being deliberately controversial?

I love my life now more than I ever thought I could. The 24 hour reading today talked about finding real friends, and I think that‚Äôs true.

Another thing that I have found extremely important in my life over the last decade is seizing opportunity. Things present themselves in such a way that you have to reach out and take it. Nothing comes without effort and every good thing that I have in my life and every accomplishment that I can be proud of today came with effort. Many times it was really hard and I wanted to give up.

I say all of this because somewhere out there, there is someone that is on day one or ten or one hundred and they‚Äôre asking themselves if this is all worth it.

- THE LANGUAGE OF THE HEART, p. 240

A sober alcoholic finds it much easier to be optimistic about life.  Optimism is the natural result of my finding myself gradually able to make the best, rather than the worst, of each situation.  As my physical sobriety continues, I come out of the fog, gain a clearer perspective and am better able to determine what courses of action to take.  As vital as physical sobriety is, I can achieve a greater potential for myself by developing an ever-increasing willingness to avail myself of the guidance and direction of a Higher Power.  My ability to do so comes from my learning - and practicing - the principles of the A.A. program.  The melding of my physical and spiritual sobriety produces the substance of a more positive life.

There is a direct linkage among self-examination, meditation, and prayer.  Taken separately, these practices can bring much relief and benefit.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 98

If I do my self-examination first, then surely, I'll have enough humility to pray and meditate - because I'll see and feel my need for them.  Some wish to begin and end with prayer, leaving the self-examination and meditation to take place in between, whereas others start with meditation, listening for advice from God about their still hidden or unacknowledged defects.  Still others engage in written and verbal work on their defects, ending with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.  These three - self-examination, meditation and prayer - form a circle, without a beginning or an end.  No matter where, or how, I start, I eventually arrive at my destination: a better life.

I'm so afraid I'm going to fail. But I need love, I need support and I need prayers. I wrote a letter to my higher power today as I completely surrendered.

Four days sober! Each day has brought different emotions. First anxiety then doubt now grateful. I know each day will be different and I'm truly trying to take it one day at a time. I'm still exploring meetings in my area to find the right fit for me. Today I tried a new one and got hit on after the meeting outside smoking a cigarette. I can't even explain how irritated I am. I shared with the group the first two sentences of the post. I was composed in the meeting, attentive, etc.

This guy comes out after and strikes up conversation saying ""you okay? looks like you were having a hard time in there"". I'm very self-aware and conscious of the vibe/energy I give off. Today was not a day I gave off the aura of ""having a hard time"". My sharing ended in an uplifting tone and it was apparent to me immediately this wasn't a friendly fellow AA attendee showing support. He started telling me where he works and how it's a great place to eat. It was so uncomfortable. I bolted.

I've had such meaningful and genuine support in the other meetings I've attended, but I drove away from this one with such irritation and disappointment. That particular meeting does not feel like a safe place. It made me incredibly self-aware that I am a young, newly sober, vulnerable woman that others may try to take advantage of. It's not something I really thought of prior to today and not where I would have expected to experience this feeling. 

I know there are plenty of other safe spaces and safe people, but I needed to vent.

While reading in my BB today I felt compelled to share this excerpt:

‚ÄúIf asked what the two most important things in re- covery are, I would have to say willingness and action. I was willing to believe that A.A. was telling me the truth. I wanted to believe it was true in a way I cannot relate in words. I wanted this thing to work. Then I be- gan to take the course of action prescribed.
Following the principles laid out in the Big Book has not always been comfortable, nor will I claim per- fection. I have yet to find a place in the Big Book that says, ‚ÄúNow you have completed the Steps; have a nice life.‚Äù The program is a plan for a lifetime of daily living. There have been occasions when the temptation to slack off has won. I view each of these as learning opportunities.
When I am willing to do the right thing, I am re- warded with an inner peace no amount of liquor could ever provide. When I am unwilling to do the right thing, I become restless, irritable, and discontent. It is always my choice. Through the Twelve Steps, I have been granted the gift of choice. I am no longer at the mercy of a disease that tells me the only answer is to drink. If willingness is the key to unlock the gates of hell, it is action that opens those doors so that we may walk freely among the living‚Äù pg 317- The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous

Meditation is something which can always be further developed.  It has no boundaries, either of width or height.  Aided by such instruction and example as we can find, it is essentially an individual adventure, something which each one of us works out in his own way.

My spiritual growth is with God as I understand Him.  With Him I find my true inner self. Daily meditation and prayer strengthen and renew my source of well-being.  I receive then the openness to accept all that He has to offer.  With God I have the reassurance that my journey will be as He wants for me, and for that I am grateful to have God in my life.

That's what it is - belonging!  After a session of meditation I knew that the feeling I was experiencing was a sense of belonging because I was so relaxed.  I felt quieter inside, more willing to discard little irritations.  I appreciated my sense of humor. What I also experience in my daily practice is the sheer pleasure of belonging to the creative flow of God's world.  How propitious for us that prayer and meditation are written right into our A.A. way of life.

For many years I pondered over God's will for me, believing that perhaps a great destiny had been ordained for my life.  After all, having been born into a specific faith, hadn't I been told early that I was 'chosen'?  It finally occurred to me, as I considered the above passage, that God's will for me was simply that I practice Step Twelve on a daily basis.  Furthermore, I realized I should do this to the best of my ability.  I soon learned that the practice aids me in keeping my life in the context of the day at hand.

1250,First Meeting,26,jt5nso,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/jt5nso/first_meeting/,18,1605222970.0,"Hi there!

I acknowledge that I have a problem with alcohol. I used to drink and lose complete control for over 15 years now and recently quit surprisingly as a side effect of a medication (April) I was taking. I then got pregnant, miscarried, and drank once in July but have not drank since then. I have not had any problem not drinking but I recognize that my relationship with alcohol is very convoluted. I told to my therapist about this and she recommended me going to an AA meeting. I have male friends in AA and friends in al-anon (I have attended al-anon myself), but I don't have anyone I feel comfortable discussing this with. 

Basically, what do I say when asked if I am an alcoholic? I have absolutely put myself in dangerous situations, tarnished relationships, and overall lost control when drinking so I know it is a problem but is it now that I don't feel the need to drink?

I should note that I am not sober sober. I do smoke weed daily and have been doing so for a long time to help sleep.

ANY advice would be appreciated. I have a zoom meeting bookmarked for tonight but am feeling too anxious to go.",26,0

Today I realised I‚Äôm only ever content when I‚Äôm helping another alcoholic. Afterwards I quickly fall back into self. The bitter moras of self loathing. Similar to how Bill describes his final drinking days. 

I used to be content in sobriety. I would enjoy sharing my spirituality with those who asked. Now for the last few months I find I‚Äôm crying every day. I‚Äôve even started to lose my composure at work. I‚Äôm waking up struggling to get out of bed when I used to spring out with determination and enthusiasm. I‚Äôm putting on weight and eating more sugar, and my clothes aren‚Äôt fitting me anymore even though I go to the gym four times a week. 

I gave up on intimate relationships not long ago after  a brief relationship ended in disappointment and hurt ego. I‚Äôm so lonely. I have a dysfunctional family that I can not turn to. I don‚Äôt understand how this can be part of gods plan for me. Life is just a continual struggle. There hasn‚Äôt been any good in my life since July when I got this new job. 

These four years of sobriety have been hell. But the meetings always lift me up. So people in the fellowship end up seeing the smiling me. They don‚Äôt know that once the meetings are over and I go home I fall back into loneliness and sadness.

Today is my 1 year anniversary.  In 2002 I got off a nasty opiate addiction, went to detox/rehab and stayed off all substances for 7 years until I decided to drink again, 5 years very steadily in NA.  I married a normie and for 10 years I slowly started drinking and smoking weed again, progressively getting worse.  Very slowly.  The addiction/obsession never left and i found ways to hide it from my wife, going from weekends to drinking heavily every night.  I don't feel normal when I am sober.  My brain feels miswired and only right when I am lit up.

Every few months, my wife would catch me sneaking alcohol, i would slow down and find better methods to hide it, etc.  I knew it was a problem a long time ago, I just didn't think catching a buzz at night after working 50 hour weeks, taking care of my kids, paying my bills, functioning as a member of society.  Finally after being caught yet again with alcohol...I realized I had to go back.  Luckily, meetings are plenty in my area, I sucked in my humility and went to one on Nov 15, 2019.  I kept going back, I loved the meetings.  I put my hand up, shared what I am doing to stay sober and met some fantastic people.  I am never, ever going to knock NA, but I finally started reading the NA texts and found them to be amazing.  Bill and Bob's story is so motivating.  Listening Joe and Charlie made me chuckle and have hope.  

I'd love to say this year has been dandelions and pleasantries....it hasn't.  A lot, and I mean a lot, of people went out during Covid.  My program is stagnant even though I speak to my sponsor and a handful of supports on the regular.  I have a son with some nasty medical issues that we have been dealing with for his whole life of 13 years.  My wife doesn't believe I am sober.  But fuck it.  I am, I am proud every day I don't drink.  I do it for myself and the rest follows.  

If someone hasn't told you the love you today, I love you all.

What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

Maintaining my spiritual condition is like working out every day, planning for the marathon, swimming laps, jogging.  It's staying in good shape spiritually, and that requires prayer and meditation.  The single most important way for me to improve my conscious contact with a Higher Power is to pray and meditate.  I am as powerless over alcohol as I am to turn back the waves of the sea; no human force had the power to overcome my alcoholism.  Now I am able to breathe the air of joy, happiness and wisdom.  I have the power to love and react to events around me with the eyes of a faith in things that are not readily apparent.  My daily reprieve means that, no matter how difficult or painful things appear today, I can draw on the power of the program to stay liberated from my cunning, baffling and powerful illness.

Update: added this post to r/ alanon. Thanks! I was unaware to post there.

I am not an alcoholic but discovered during my relationship my boyfriend is. 

On weekends he spends Friday and Saturday as well as Sunday at my home. He brings 15 packs of beer with him and usually completes the packs each night. 15 on Friday and 15 on Saturday.

Friday I had to run an errand. When I came back 2 hours later  he had downed almost 15 beers.  He ended up throwing up. It just broke my heart.  I have spoken to him about his alcohol use and asked questions about why he drinks but I know he is not going to  change for anyone but himself. 

Saturday came and I  deeply  resented everytime I would hear a can open. It came to the point I could no longer stand the sound. I was on the verge of screaming but just cried instead and told him to stop and please come to bed because I worry about him.

There were cans everywhere. I hate myself for allowing him to do this in my home. It has been months of this. I feel I am enabling his drinking and don't want to anymore. 

How do I go about telling him he is welcome here but not with beer ?  I know he will drink at his own home.

I did not end up mentioning recovery, because it did not seem to fit in naturally anywhere, even though when asked ""what is a problem you have faced and how did you overcome it"" its like...let me tell you about the biggest problem! Alcohol use to be the biggest problem in my life.

Instead I talked about the problems I was able to confront bc I got sober - like public speaking! A few months into getting sober I joined a Toastmaster club and began practicing public speaking in a group setting, with help from others with a similar passion for learning. Fast forward two years and I just completed a final interview to join a org whose values are based in service to others. 

I think when people say that sobriety and working the steps is the coolest thing they have ever done, I get it now. I came into AA to stop drinking morning, noon, and night.

The agonies and the void that I often felt inside occur less and less frequently in my life today.  I have learned to cope with solitude.  It is only when I am alone and calm that I am able to communicate with God, for He cannot reach me when I am in turmoil.  It is good to maintain contact with God at all times, but it is absolutely essential that, when everything seems to go wrong, I maintain that contact through prayer and meditation.

At Christmas I got a GI Joe. I never played with him because Barbie‚Äôs clothes didn‚Äôt fit on him

I started first grade when I was 5. I was the youngest and smallest kid. Second grade I was sick a lot. By third grade I was being called a girly boy and a sissy. I wondered why I was a boy. I felt like I was a girl and my personal part didn‚Äôt seem to belong on my body. I wished I was a girl but I was afraid anyone would find out. I was ashamed of feeling like a girl. I learned to hate myself at a very early age. I also never let anyone know I really was a girl.¬† I wanted to play with the girls in grade school. The nuns insisted I play with the boys. They bullied me. I threw like a girl they didn‚Äôt want to play with me. At 13 I went trick or treating as a ballerina. Everyone thought I was a girl. It made me feel wonderful.

I started pretending to be mean and cuss a lot to pretend to be more of a boy. I learned how to recognize my femininity and hide it. I also became attracted to other boys and had to hide that too. I really learned to hate myself even more going to that catholic school..

By high school I found alcohol and drugs to control my feelings. I could ease the pain by using. By the time I was 19 I had been arrested for possession and drunk driving. I went to chef school and concentrated on my career. I did well as I put the destructive behavior behind me and advanced my knowledge and career. I did what was expected of me.

I got married and had children. I bought a house and had a good career. The drinking became worse and worse. The guilt that I was living a lie was consuming me. I despised myself. I lost my first born child and my nephew. I had lost all faith. There was no God. If there was a God then why did I have these feelings for men?¬† Why did I have these feelings I was a girl? I drank so I didn‚Äôt have to feel anything. I was living in hell surrounded by pain.

I became known as Angry Al. I was a mean disrespectful, nasty man. I hated the world and I was a full blown alcoholic. I was told I had diabetes. I knew I had to quit drinking or I would die a horrible death. My marriage was almost over I had damaged it so much.

I got sober. I started to go to AA meetings. I was sick of living a lie. The first week I worked a fund raiser for the Lions Club. Everyone was drinking and I ran out of there into my frozen car in the middle of a snow storm.¬† I sat there and I said oh God how am I going to do this? That is when I realized how wrong I was to exclude God from my life. I started praying and begged God to forgive me. I started to look for a church where I felt welcome. I stayed sober by the grace of God. The fourth step required me to be brutally honest with myself.

As I was about to turn 50 I was desperate to live truthfully. I was determined to stay sober no matter what. I was 2.5 years into sobriety when I came out as a gay man. I was sick of living a lie, a lie that had consumed my very soul. I knew if I wasn‚Äôt honest with myself I would surely relapse. I made myself 3 promises and I came out. I was terminated by my employer when they found out. My wife filed for divorce and I went about the task of learning to live in the lgbt community. I never did have a drink through all of this. The day after I came out I got my ears pierced. I insisted on rainbow daises for the starter earrings. I started buying other jewelry. Then I started using makeup and nail polish.

What I didn‚Äôt realize was that I was starting to transition. I could let my guard down and become as feminine as I wanted. After all I was gay and some gay men are feminine. I had no understanding of transgender people but I knew several. They also knew me and they knew I was transgender but I had to figure that out for myself. I had found a male partner and settled in to a domestic partnership.

On the ten year anniversary of my sobriety I read a national enquirer article about an Olympic athlete that was transitioning to female. I read that article and afterwards I said out loud:‚ÄùI wish I could do that‚Äù! I immediately got scared. I went home that day and spent the next two weeks researching what transgender was. I got confused. I went to you tube and found three videos titled am I transgender?¬† I watched them all. The first one the hair was standing up on the back of my neck. The second one I started crying and by the end of the third one I knew.

It was super bowl Sunday February 1 , 2015. The game was over and I was on the couch all alone crying. I had no idea how I was going to do this. I remembered the 3 promises I had made myself. 1) I will never again lie about who I was. 2) I would never again be ashamed of who I was. 3) I would never again drink or try to hurt myself. I remembered coming out to insure my continued sobriety.¬† I remembered the third step of AA. Turn your will and your life over to the care of God. I realized God chose to enlighten me on the ten year anniversary of my sobriety. This was his plan. This was too much for me to do on my own so I turned it over to God since it was God that put me on this path. I decided that this wasn‚Äôt the first time I came out but it would be the last. I went in and shaved all the hair off my body. I put nail polish on and went to bed. The next morning I put on makeup jewelry combed my hair more feminine and buttoned my chef coat on the left. I looked in the mirror and I said you are Alyna now. I was terrified but I went to work.

That started a year and a half of write ups and eventual termination. Half of my family disowned me. My husband left me as he hated women. I was sexually assaulted. One night I attempted suicide. I sat in my car reaching for a gun to end my pain. I felt I had ruined my life and I had nothing left to live for.¬† I started going to my therapist and support groups at the lgbt center. I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with extreme depression and anxiety and I was put on medication for it. I got another job and went through more discrimination. I was outed as transgender to the staff before I even started. Again I went through hell. Once again the thoughts of suicide gripped me.

My mother came around. She told me that when she was on her way to the hospital to have me she hoped I was a girl so my sister would have a playmate. She squeezed my hand and told me she got her wish.

I started working for a large international food service company. I told nobody I was transgender. Nobody outed me my secret was safe. Five months in to my employment I agreed to be the key note speaker for the main fund raiser for the Milwaukee LGBT center. On that day I allowed my staff to read my speech. I was now once again out at work. This time I was not judged harshly. I told my story to 600 people at the fund raiser. I got a standing ovation. So many people came up to me and hugged me. Young trans kids came up to me and said I had given them hope that they were ready to cash it in. I was told I was an inspiration.

I joined the Pride ERG at work and shared my experience and my speech. The Vice president of Diversity called and wanted to speak to me.¬† I was being celebrated for who I was. All of my dreams were coming true. I could be successful and be myself. I could bring all of myself to work every day. I could be the best version of myself! I learned that the insurance would pay for my gender reassignment surgery. I got an appointment with a surgeon and my surgery was approved! I was so excited everything was going so well.

I was asked to attend the out and equal conference by my employer. They flew me to Seattle to attend. My company wins and award for the most inclusive lgbt workplace in the world. All of us go on stage to accept the award. They ask me to hold the award up in front of 6000 people. Here I was holding an award for the most inclusive lgbt workplace in the world. Me a transgender woman!¬† It was the proudest moment of my life. I wasn‚Äôt a disgrace. I wasn‚Äôt a freak! All of the people from corporate were so proud of me. I was an inspiration. I had the courage to become the person I was always meant to be. My employer enabled me to be the best chef I could be. The best manager I could be. All of my prayers were answered! Three weeks later I had my Gender confirmation Surgery. I was finally complete. I was a whole person. I would never have had all this happen if I hadn‚Äôt been hired by them. Working for that company truly changed my life. 3 months later I was asked to tell my story as a panelist on an international webinar. That webinar is now part of the diversity training for the company.

A year later I was walking down the aisle in a wedding dress. I was getting married to a kind gentle loving man. He waited for me as I underwent my reassignment surgery. He is always there for me. If I had ended my life when things were bad I never would have gotten to the good parts. I would have missed out on the parts where I was celebrated for who I am. As bad as things got for me the good things blew all of that way! Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. All I needed to do was to have faith. I needed to remember that I had turned myself over to Gods care. Through all of this I never did have a drink,

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I am now living my life as a wife and grandmother. Life is good. I have been through so much but I never gave up. Now I have a soul mate to grow old with. I am now disabled. My body was in bad shape and I had numerous surgeries to fix it. I have no regrets. I just have to remember it works if you work it. Acceptance is the key to all of my problems. I had to accept an awful lot. I am no worse for the wear. I came into AA as a miserable angry man and I am now a happy, joyful, friendly, beautiful woman.¬† I was lucky. I count my blessings every day.",52,0

Happiness is such an elusive state. How often do my 'prayers' for others involve 'hidden' prayers for my own agenda?  How often is my search for happiness a boulder in the path of growth for another, or even myself?  Seeking growth through humility and acceptance brings things that appear to be anything but good, wholesome and vital.  Yet in looking back, I can see that pain, struggles and setbacks have all contributed eventually to serenity through growth in the program.  I ask my Higher Power to help me not cause another's lack of growth today - or my own.

He was my best friend and hero. He was one of the few people that I felt really understanded me, and I think he felt the same way.

About 6 years ago, while addicted to heroin, he decided to head to a gas station. Steal a candy bar an eat it - forcing the store owner to call the police - he was picked up and brought to jail - given an ouststanding warrant. - He spent a good 6 months in jail - got sober during this period. After lived in a half way house with other recovering addicts, walking about a mile to the bus stop every day and back, carrying his electrician work tools. He eventually moved into a recovery apartment and while other roomates messed up- he remained sober. He kept doing well at work - got an old 4 runner (with abrethalizer) - He eventually moved into his own apartment, then eventually another nice apartment - bought a new car (still with breathalizer) until finally he could get rid of it. He kept doing great at work, getting raises, and this year bought a house. Took his kids on a couple of vacations. He was an amazing dad. ---- I hung out with him nearly every Sunday for the last few years. I did not know him through about 20 years of addiction. I was so so happy to have him in my life again. We watched a lot of movies and sports and he fed me often when I came over. I could not ask for a better brother. We laughed so much - he was a rock in my life in many ways. ---- So... he reached out to an old girlfriend- an addict - (you see where this is going) - he got some of that sweet loving again and that highest price  - several days ago his daughter, my niece found him on the floor. - he fell off the train - 2 empty needles . He had just bought a used work truck - had no intention of getting out of this place. But SHIT HAPPENS, and what an appropriate year  for this to happen... what a fucking year... But I want to thank AA for how much you helped him in life!!!!! It helped him get his life back. I attended several meetings and was incredibly touched by the realness and stories. You are some strong people and I honor you. He constantly talked about how speaking in front of the group was good for him. How the meetings and breakfasts were so good for him. I saw REAL FRIENDS in his life. This is one of the best organizations on the planet and it means the world that it helped my brother so much. I wish you all strength, peace, and joy in your life. I am not sure what a mess this big paragraph is, but I just had to say thank you. I truly wish you all joy and peace in life.

There was a point during my words in front of everyone where I asked if there is anyone present from AA. About 14 people raised their hands. It choked me up them and it chokes me up now. I said ""Thank you for your influence in his life."" - I cannot say enough about this organization. The incredible men in his life. Helped him move furniture in the snow - many meals, many visits, TRUE FRIENDS. I am so humbled by all of you. If noyone has told you GREAT JOB today - I will tell you, great job!!!!!

I quit drinking back in August and this is the longest I've been sober by choice in recent years! While I've experienced cravings only a couple of times since quitting, they are enough to remind me that I'm never safe if left to my own devices. Usually by this time I have full blown alcoholic amnesia and I forget that I can't moderate my drinking. Usually by about 90 days (seems to be the reoccurring theme) I'm just beginning to prove to myself that I can moderate. 90 days is usually about the time I say to myself and my partner, ""sEe... I OnLy HaD 2 dRiNkS a CoUpLe tImEs ThIs wEek,"" which quickly turns into, ""sEe, I oNlY bLaCkEd oUt oNcE tHiS wEeK."" But it always ends the same within a matter of days to weeks, rarely taking any longer. Its insidious nature presents an illusion of self-control. It starts by establishing a false sense of security. It demands that I bet with confidence on the tiny bit of dignity I've managed to get back in the meager 3 months. It demands that I risk that regained sense of dignity in exchange for my pride all while knowing that the odds get worse over time and they will NEVER be in my favor. When I inevitably fail at maintaining self-control, that dignity turns into compounded guilt and withdrawals, which get exponentially worse every. single. time.

But... I've made it past 90 days! I've made it past 100 days! It's been 101 days since I've had a drink. My dignity comes back a little bit at a time every single day. The self-confidence that's (slowly) coming back reminds me that I don't have to be in control of everything all the time. Some times it's better to just admit defeat. It's empowering and humbling to admit that I have an enemy and it's stronger than me! But hey, as long as I'm never back in the ring with the enemy I'll never have to get the shit kicked out of me ever again.. not by alcohol and certainly not today Satan, not today.",58,0

I found out she cheated on me before we got married 6 times. She is at a sober living house and we are separated. I went on a worse bender after I found the note i was never supposed to see. I was doing well at cutting down to just drinking on darts/pool nights and not getting sloppy. Which was a big step for me.  

I know this is for sobriety, yet the things I've invested my time into and love to do almost always revolve around a bar. I feel like it's going to be harder to get sober and cut out my only fun activities. I know I can find more activities but I want to stop drinking but still play the games I love and have put years and time to get good. 

Also her being away from me is really hard on me now. I feel ashamed that I want this but am currently drinking now. 

I've been to a few AA meetings and I'm not a religious person, it almost feels like I'm cheating myself out of my work by saying that I have to give my higher power and thank them for giving me the power. I feel that if I stop drinking I should be the one that gets the credit. Im open to any and all explanations or if there is another type of group that sounds better for me please please let me know.

I have gone through the steps multiple times and more importantly its a way of living for me.
I was an IV heroin addict and physical alcoholic.  I have been to 5 in patient rehabs, countless detoxes and hospitals/psych wards. None of that matters...
I have found a that the 12 steps have been the only way to achieve recovery contingent on the daily work of 10, 11 and 12.
It didn't come easy. 7 or 8 years I was in and out of AA and I would get some sobriety here and there (1 years, 6 month few months here and there). But it brought me here and to a lineage of sponsors at are Big Book enthusiasts and we live in the work and in the book.

I started drinking when I was around 17 years old just outta school waiting for college to start. Around April 2012. My friend introduced me to alcohol. It was first for both us. People usually hate the taste of alcohol when they drink it the first time. I was not I cherished every last drop of it. I think the reason for me liking it so much was because for 17 years my parents told me alcohol is bad for you. And being a teenager I was naive and eager and that constant nagging about alcohol made me want it even more. 

So college started people party people study people make friends people build relationships. I on the other hand befriended a couple of friends who liked just staying in college. I was an exact opposite I rarely visited college. My attendance was below 15%. Now let me explain in details what I used to do everyday. Drinking started small like 2-3 drinks a day. It takes people time to become highly addicted to alcohol. But not me within a few months I was drinking 0.5L of whisky everyday by September 2012. 
My daily routine wake up get ready wait for the wine shop to open buy 0.25L of whisky open it drink it straight from bottle i guess my record for 4 seconds. Have a couple of cigarettes. Doze off for half an hour in car eat something very very unhealthy then reach college call a friend of mine lets go out. Play a bit snooker. Have lunch. Visit the wine shop. Buy another 0.25L straight down. Eat something unhealthy go home. Smoke till i cough and go to sleep. At that time it looked like its a good life as i was under constant influence of alcohol. I was always I could do anything. I am the best. No one can stop me. But that was all in just my head. In real life I was just drinking. 

By the time my college ended in June 2015 I was drinking 1L of whisky everyday that too NEAT. I knew the implications of getting a liver disease. But I thought it was long shot & my actual mentality at that f**cking point of time was SO WHAT THERE IS ALWAYS A LIVER TRANSPLANT. Its cool. I can get a liver transplant. Lets drink more. 

By that time I was working. My routine. Wake up get ready go to wine shop buy 4 miniatures. Drink it right from bottles. Eat unhealthy. Go to work. Before lunch go to wine shop. Buy another 0.25L drink it eat unhealthy. Think I can do anything while doing literally nothing. Go to work. Pass some time. Around 5pm go to wine shop buy 0.5L. Go home. Have 0.25L eat dinner. Have another 0.25L and pass the f**k out. I usually blacked out. 

I remember some times when I woke up I used to find piss on my bedroom floor. I did not even had the motor skills to reach bathroom I guess I just woke up and pissed on floor & went back to sleep. 
I remember one day I bought a stock of whisky around 4L as the shops were gonna be closed for 3 days due to national holidays. I was at home. Drank 3L in 2 days. That day when I was left with only 1 bottle. I by chance broke it. You know what I did. I picked up the pieces of glass. Got a cloth. Cleaned the whisky & emptied it into a glass. I recovered whatever I could. And i drank it. That i was my first night sober in last 4 years. I could not sleep that night. My head was heavy my eyes were rigid my hands were trembling like crazy. I wanted to pull out my hair. 

Till 2017 I had the same routine. Its not like I was not aware of anything. I used to read articles about alcohol poisoning liver cancer cirrhosis. But you know THERE IS ALWAYS A LIVER TRANSPLANT. I was so f**king dumb. 

In august 2017 i decided i wanna stop drinking. I did not drink the entire day. And when i went home I started experiencing a pain on my right side below the chest which eventually started rating to my back & abdomen. I first I though it was gas & took a medicine for it but by midnight the pain was unbearable. My parents rushed me to a nearby hospital where I was given strong pain killers. Early that morning was taken to a good hospital. I was in excruciating even after the pain killers. I was rushed into emergency.

1304,A 8 Year Journey From A Man Who Drank 1.5L Alcohol A Day To A Man Who Hates Alcohol PART-2,12,k0wosm,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/k0wosm/a_8_year_journey_from_a_man_who_drank_15l_alcohol/,2,1606325820.0,"I am lying in emergency room half unconscious listening to the conversation. The doctor walks upto me and asks how much do I drink daily. Still a bit conscious seeing my parents standing there I said approx 250ml daily. He closed the curtains blocking my view of my parents and asked again. I lied again but this time i told around half a litre. I was so ashamed of telling the truth. I was admitted in the hospital with a case of acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse. 

My blood was tested. The liver panel values which were supposed to be bellow 50 were crossing 2000. I could see the look on doctor‚Äôs face how his expression changed from a poker face to an extremely surprised look. I know his exact thoughts were how could someone so young could have abused alcohol so much. I was told acute pancreatitis majorly occurs in people who have been drinking for a lot of years. Majorly after the age of 40. It was rare for someone so young to be diagnosed with it that too due to alcohol abuse. 

When I was lying in emergency room I saw a patient on a stretcher being rushed towards me and his bed was just placed next to me. Instantly  a breathing tube was put in his mouth and an oxygen mask on his face. He was unconscious. I heard the nurses and doctor talk. They were saying he‚Äôs here for the third time. Later I found out he had liver cirrhosis. He was admitted twice before. He was here the third time. And diagnosis you ask ? Complete liver failure due to drinking. Sometimes we just cant stop right. 

When I was in the hospital room my parents walked upto me and asked when did you drink so much ? My parents had no idea I drank this much. Initially I started blaming them for my situation I said if you hadn‚Äôt filled my head with garbage that drinking is bad for you and let me be I would be like any other average joe drinking normally it was your constant nagging that forced me to go this far.

 Did you know there is no cure for pancreatitis? No medicines for treatment & recovery ? The only thing you can do is don‚Äôt eat anything don‚Äôt drink anything so you don‚Äôt put unnecessary pressure on the pancreas and let it heal. Thats all you can do. I was told I could never ever drink again in my life. Never Never Never Never. Because your pancreas becomes sensitive to alcohol. When I heard that it was like a bomb has been dropped on me. Oh my god I will never be able to enjoy the sweet nectar of gods ever again. What will I do when my friends drink ? What will I do in parties ? What will I do in clubs ? What will I do on holidays ? All these questions started rushing through my head. 

Let me tell you about my condition in hospital. My stomach was swollen I could not drink anything I could not eat anything. For 4 days I was just given fluids through the IV. The days were bad and the nights were terrible. During the day I was agitated hot and in pain. I was sweating in a cold room. I was in so much pain that even to move a little bit caused a pain so excruciating that radiated from my abdomen to my lower back. My mother was there beside me till the end. I used to see her while I was almost crying in pain. Her tears. I kept thinking in my head what the fuck did I do my mother is crying because me. How did I end up there. 

I was given pain killers 3 times a day to ease the pain. But it was no use. It felt like candy as it did not even reduce the pain by 1% At night I used to scream & cry in pain. I was sleepy but I could not sleep due to high levels of pain. I called nurse every 15 minutes and asked her to call the doctor for medicine. I was even given painkillers at night along with sleeping medicines. I remember one night I was in a lot of pain. Doctor saw it. He gave me a pain killer. He warned me that its only used in cases where the patient is in extreme pain. But the medicine is so strong that if used a lot will certainly cause kidney failure. I went for it. IT DID NOT WORK. After 15 minutes I was again crying in pain. The nurse gave me a sleeping pill. No use. The pain was unbearable !!  

After 4 days the pain started reducing. I was introduced to water again. I could only have a couple of small sips whenever I wanted to drink. I was still revolting so I drank an entire glass. Bad choice. It hit me so hard that I curled up into a ball tears out of eyes. It was painful. 

7th day I was given juices & coconut water time to time. To drink that juice was heaven for me. I did not realise that drinking juice will make me cry. I missed it much so. I missed the food. Even thinking of a standard bland dish made me crave it. I was not feeling much pain till then. But a little extra movement and there is the pain. I used to press my abdomen to check if it was still paining. For 10 days I could only pee. I remember on the 6th day I peed and it was celebrated as an achievement. Who could have thought peeing could be an achievement. 

On the 10th day I was introduced to food again. My menu A bed tea Porridge for breakfast, a light balanced meal, a very light balanced meal. I remember eating for the first time in days. The pleasure I felt. That cheap hospital food tasted like it was out of a 5 star restaurant. The 2 biscuits given with tea felt like these biscuits were made specially according to my whims & fancies. I guess the quote is right ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt know what you have until its gone‚Äô 

The day i pooped decided when I could be discharged. Before I was discharged I was given counselling. I was told 90% of the patients soon return with same problem. They do not change. I guess it was reverse psychology as I replied I will never drink I will never come back. I promised my parents I promised my doctors. I promised myself that I will be a happy sober man. I left the hospital after 12 days. 

I was a changed man. I had a changed mindset. My routine changed drastically. I woke up. Went to work. Came back home by 5pm. Actually started sleeping by 7pm. When I used to drink I was up until 12am. So that was a change I had more time. I changed my diet completely. Lost 8kgs. I was radiant I was glowing. I was a changed man. I was completely healed. There was no pain. Thinking all is fine I started eating a bit unhealthy but that was fine. 

Then one evening when I was coming home. I said to myself. I am healed a lot. All my blood tests are now completely good. My liver is healed as well. So I decided why not buy a bottle of whisky to celebrate. So I got a 250ml bottle. And went home. I was thinking earlier I used to drink neat. That‚Äôs the reason I got pancreatitis. If I dilute it with water. I will be fine & it will not impact much. And earlier used to drink without a pause direct from bottle so I will now slow down the pace. I poured a 60ml drink & added another 60 of water. I started drinking slow. It was no fun. Old habits die hard. Next one i galloped. Within a few minutes all was done. As I was drinking after a few months the alcohol tasted funny & hit me really hard. I dozed off within an hour. Next morning I did not feel any pain. 

Thinking now I was fine I again bought a bottle. I guess within a month I was back to my former self drinking about a litre whisky daily. I even lied to my girlfriend about my problem. I told her that the doctor has said I can drink from time to time. She was so innocent & naive. She trusted me and let me have a few drinks whenever we were together. I forgot to mention. I have a gf since 2015. She, for 2 years believed that I have already cut down on alcohol. I made her believe that she changed me. I was a different man because of her. But behind her back I was galloping 1.5l a day. 

Drinking this much people might think how in the hell can my parents even my own girlfriend did not doubt me. Over the years I grew quite resilient to alcohol. It took half a litre to make me walk funny. So drinking small quantities during the day did not show any significant changes in my speech or my walk or actions. So no one was able to guess that I was under the influence of alcohol all the time. 

Back to the story. I was back to my former self. I went on a trip with my girlfriend. You already know where I am going with this. I drank and drank and drank. From beer to wine to whisky to vodka. And not just in parties. I remember I used to wake up early while my girlfriend was still sleeping. I would go out. Look for a wine shop. Get half a bottle of whisky. Bring it back. Hiding it from my sleeping gf. I took it inside the hotel room bathroom & galloped it down. Came outside ordered some breakfast. Ate it so my gf could not smell alcohol on my breath. I used to do it daily for a week we were there. 

After returning home. I was again back to drinking 1.5l daily. And within days I started experiencing the same pain. Not severe. But the same. I remember that day it was January 2017 morning. I was in my car. Holding my abdomen with one hand & drinking whisky with other. I drank the bottle. And I instantly puked inside the car on the foot rest area of the front passenger seat. Thats when the pain enhanced to the level it was unbearable. I tried subsiding it taking a pain killer but no use. It was hell. I waited in a mall‚Äôs parking for an hour holding my abdomen in pain & crying. Sweating in car with AC on max. Thinking how I am gonna face my parents. I knew I needed to be be hospitalised immediately. But I did not have the guts to face anyone. When the pain got out of hand. I was done. I got up holding my abdomen. Threw the floor mat on the passenger seat outside cleaned it with water as much as I could and drove off. I hurried towards my girlfriend‚Äôs house. 

When I reached her place. I called her and asked her to come out immediately. She asked what happened ? I had only one answer If you love me come outside. She came running. I already changed seats and shifted to the passenger side. She came & sat on the driver‚Äôs seat thinking I do not wish to drive. She asked me again what happened ? I just said I did it again & asked her to rush to the hospital. I did not have the guts to go to the same hospital and face the doctors. Throughout the entire drive I was sweating profusely. Crying holding my abdomen. My gf was consoling me everything will be alright. We will ask the doctor why it happened again. YOU DONT EVEN DRINK NOW. Hearing that I drowned in pool of self loathing. What the hell did I do again. She got me to emergency. Where I was admitted. Diagnosis : ACUTE PANCREATITIS

I don't know what to say, I have nothing clear to say.

I really don't want to be alone and when I use alcohol it feels like I am not even though I am. I have been consuming more than before lately and I want it to stop but I have no idea how. I also tried to call this help-line in my city but again dropped the call instantly when they answered. I don't know what can I say. Why is life so horrifying and lonely? I am not brave enough to be there alone around all those people. Maybe this can be my day one. Can I really do this alone? I suppose the only way anything ever gets done is alone, but it is heartbreaking.

Then I looked to see if maybe I just poured it and didn‚Äôt drink it.. but no I saw I had sipped from the glass, it‚Äôs charcoal flavor must have burned so good all the way down.

I managed to burn my life to the ground in a few short years. Not only did Alcoholics Anonymous give me a way out, it gave me a community of beautiful people who understand me and a life beyond what I could have imagined. Shit is still hard, I make mistakes all the time, and there‚Äôs a whole hell of a lot that I‚Äôm powerless over. But when I zoom out and look at my whole life, instead of getting bogged down by the daily grind, I am exceedingly grateful, and awestruck, really. 

Then: hallucinating, willing to do nearly anything for a mind-altering substance, failing out of school, miserable, friendless, alone, sleeping in my car, living to drink, drinking to live, unable to imagine a life with or without alcohol

Now: a year and a half away from being finished with medical school, a host of friends, a beautiful apartment, living consciously and with compassion for every being, very much able to imagine my future. I concede, sometimes miserable, but medical school is like that, lol. 

So they say, it‚Äôs a design for living that works in rough going.

I was lying in emergency IV hooked to me. My girlfriend was looking after all the formalities of admission. She asked me to call my parents when I refused she called herself. Explained them the situation. My parents came.  half unconscious I saw my girlfriend explaining my parents what happened. They rudely replied ‚Äòwe know‚Äô my parents blamed her for my condition saying that why did she let me drink even after knowing my condition. A tear rolled down my eye seeing that. It was not her fault. I lied to her. She was not aware about the severity. And there she was standing there taking blame. She left and my parents approached me. 

The first question my mother asked me ‚ÄòHave you no shame‚Äô I was lying there listening. But I did not respond & closed my eyes so they think I am not completely conscious. I saw my father‚Äôs face. He was not looking at me. His eyes were filled with anger. He did not want to face me. I felt so ashamed. I let down my father. He lost all respect for me. I could feel that he was just there to perform his duty as a father. My mother crying. My father disappointed. What the f**k did I do again ? How the f**k did I end up here again ? The pain was of same intensity but this time my mind was numb to pain. Like it already knew this was going to happen. I was moved to the hospital bed. My mother on the side sofa. My father came in the room. I was awake now & was staring out the window. I did not want to face anyone. 

My mother was on sofa praying when my father walked in. He looked at my mother and said I am going back to work & I have admitted him. My mother asked him to stay. I will always remember what he said. Why should I stay ? Why because of his addiction his poor choices I have to suffer my work has to suffer. He cannot take care of himself. How the f**k can we ? He did this to himself. All on his own his own. His own choices. He will never change. And we cannot do anything about it. We can be there for him when he is at home. We cannot be there for him holding his hand every single second of his life to see that he does not drink. He does not slip. He does not die. Its upto him. He drank. We hospitalised him. He drank again. We hospitalized him again. Thats all I can do. Its upto him. What he wants to do. I am going. He left. 

I was still staring out the window. My body was in so much pain. But my mind was numb. I wanted to scream that its paining ! But I did not. I could not. I did it to myself. Again ! The treatment was the same. I was put on IV. At nights I used to cry silently so no one hears. When my mother was asleep (she was stuck again taking care of me) I used to take my IV stand and walk out to the nurse. And ask for pain killers. Even to move I had to go through excruciating pain. I dont know how I did that. Maybe because I was experiencing so much guilt & fear. I did not want anyone to find out this time. Because me winding up in the hospital again was all my doing. No one asked me to drink. No one forced me to drink. Everyone was 200% supportive. 

But here I was, lying in hospital again. So whose fault was that. It was mine ! I was the one who was not able to control. I was the one who slipped. I was one who did not even have the spine to stop drinking knowing it was killing me. Not slowly but very very fast. I just kept thinking. 

I am not a coward. I am not dependent on alcohol. My life of is not dependent on alcohol. My happiness is not dependent on alcohol. My choices are not dependent on alcohol. The problems which I might be going through my life will not be solved by drinking. I did not want to forget my problems. I wanted to solve them. Face them. 

I think that might be the reason I started drinking. When I was young I always saw liquor as ‚Äòliquid courage‚Äô My father was a very unexpressive person. As I told you I can count the number of times we actually hugged. He in an honest man. He was always quiet with me. I was provided with everything I wanted. He never refused. He was there for me always. But I never got a fatherly feeling from him. But 2 drinks down my father was a changed man. He was smiling. He was talkative. He used to become so generous after getting drunk. He loved spending time with me when he drank. We talked about everything. But the next morning. Silence hits the room again. So I saw what alcohol did to his personality. And I liked it. Being a dumb kid I wished for him to be drunk all the time. 

Back to the story. I realised that thinking that alcohol was the solution to my problems. To be a person everyone desires and wants to be around. Laying in the hospital bed I though of how I was 4 years before & how I am now. The comparison was an eye opener. Let me tell you what all my precious alcohol gave me. It gave me a shitty physique. In those 4 years My weight fluctuated between 75-98 kgs. It gave me a weaker eyesight. I started wearing specs. And my lens power increased every year. It gave me a shitty work life. After 2 years I was still right there where I started. Zero ! I had nothing to show for it. I almost lost my gf as I grew distant. Because I was more in love with alcohol. It left me with a crippled body & mind. 

I recovered fast this time. I was out of the hospital in 6 days. I had a new perspective. My mind was completely enlightened now. I knew that alcohol is no longer an option. I was a changed man. A man who no longer drinks. I accepted that fact and used to say it people. That I do not drink anymore. I used to teach people how alcohol is so bad for you. How its gonna ruin your life. And I am alcohol free now. It feels so good. I feel so fresh now. Life was very pleasant. I even joined a gym. It was going extremely well. I started homeopathy medicine for healing my pancreas. I started eating light & healthy. I started sleeping very well. I no longer felt the need to drink.

Month out of the hospital. One night I was watching a movie in my bed. If anyone recalls ‚ÄòEuro Trip‚Äô I was halfway through the movie. I was at the scene where four of them go to a nightclub in Bratislava and one of the guys gets so drunk that he kisses his sister. Damn that was funny. But the thought that came in my head was damn ! Wish I could get drunk and have fun again ! I slapped my self for thinking that and went to sleep. Next morning I woke up. Went to work. On my way back from home. I was listening music. My mind was blank. I was driving by a liquor shop.  A thing I used to do whenever I passed by a liquor shop was to press my abdomen to check for pun. Seeing it I  pressed my abdomen to check whether there was pain. I did not feel anything. But this time. I pressed again & harder. It was fine. I took a U turn parked my car right outside the liquor shop. Got out. Approached the shop.

Hey Can I get a 250ml bottle of whisky ?!

AA saved my life and I have 2 and a half years sober as of last month. However, I feel quite strongly about this - we should not turn our back on newcomers who struggled with drugs in addition to alcohol; to do so is in my opinion against the very spirit of generosity and altruism that ties us all together. 

With the opioid crisis the way that it is, there are so many people who need the hand of AA. Sometimes, NA meetings can not be good or even available in particular areas - this is nothing specifically bad about the program of NA, it is just that their meetings are not as popular in some regions; in my college town for example there were 15 AA meetings a week and 1 NA meeting. Turning people away for something as trivial as a different preferred drug seems unfair to me. 


I clearly feel very strongly about this. The program and the fellowship has always changed through the decades. The big book has plenty of stories of drug use in it - the doctor injecting morphine and sprinting to his bedroom before he passes out and other stories of people abusing sedatives. Hell; Bill himself used belladonna and LSD. 


In my experience, the younger and more geographically urban a meeting is, the less they care if you bring up other drugs in addition to alcohol. I‚Äôve only really experienced this ‚Äújudgmental old timer telling off the junkie‚Äù thing in rural meetings.

I‚Äôm open to having my belief challenged here, but in 2020, I do not believe it is right anymore to turn people away because they were shooting dope instead of downing half gallons. The symptoms of spiritual malady are the same, regardless of preferred intoxicant.


Open to having my beliefs challenged here - let me know what you guys think. I just don‚Äôt see the benefit in telling people not to mention drugs in an AA meeting - what could possibly be the benefit in this modern time?


TLDR:

Nooooooo you can‚Äôt just talk about drugerinos in an aa meeting! This is a group for those who want to stop drinking noooooo

Edit to add: Thank you for the encouragement to open up and be honest. However I'm very newly sober and not ready to tell my mom I'm in recovery.

90 days ago today I hit a meeting after being released from the hospital. I was in for 15 days with 9 of them being in the ICU. Respiratory failure due to Delirium Tremens. Thanks to the good docs, I was resuscitated and intubated.  

They tried to bring me down off of the sedation but couldn't because I would freak out and rip out my IVs and try to escape... Afer 12 days of being completely psychotic, they told my wife that there is a possibility that I will not come out of this. ""Wet brain"" is REAL and it was the first either my wife or I have heard that severe alcohol withdrawal can cause permanent brain damage. I was still hallucinating and thinking that the people in the hospital were actually part of a mind-stealing organization trying to take my brain. Nobody, not even my wife could convince me that it wasn't 100% real.. The nurses had their cloth masks but they looked like sinister disguises. Every time I would wake up and find the designated babysitting nurse sitting there, it looked like she had an identical mini-nurse sitting on her lap that she would pet and stroke like an evil cat. More screaming would ensue. Those poor nurses...

On day 13 I started to come out of psychosis and passed some cognitive tests but could not walk without a walker.  They told me I was going to be needing the walker for for awhile while I learn how to walk again. I'm 46 and it all became frighteningly real at that moment. What have I done?

They tell me that once you go into DTs, it is highly likely that even a light binge would send me back and it could be permanent. I fear permanent insanity like that much worse than i fear death. Drinking is no longer an option if I value a sound mind.

I've gone to 90+ meetings in 90 days. I'm reading the book for the second time through. I have a sponsor and working step 4. I have a higher power of my own understanding. For today, my compulsion to drink has been lifted.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 106

As I continued to go to meetings and work the Steps, something began to happen to me.  I felt confused because I wasn't sure what it was that I was feeling, and then I realized I was experiencing serenity.  It was a good feeling, but where had it come from? Then I realized it had come '... as the result of these steps.'  The program may not always be easy to practice, but I had to acknowledge that my serenity had come to me after working the Steps.  As I work the Steps in everything I do, practicing these principles in all my affairs, now I find that I am awake to God, to others, and to myself.  The spiritual awakening I have enjoyed as the result of working the Steps is the awareness that I am no longer alone.

My wife is sleeping so to avoid waking her by rummaging about, I quietly unhooked the coat from the back of our bedroom door in the dark, crept up the landing and quietly got my headphones out.

I had a disturbing feeling of daja vu. Because when I was in the grip of my alcoholism, this little dance routine of quietly getting the coat was a regular occurance. So I could go out, without waking her, to go and find some late night off license somewhere because I had run out of alcohol.

And I had ALWAYS run out of alcohol.

When it dawned on me why it felt so weird, it was like cold ice in my stomach. I looked out the window. Absolutely hammering it down, freezing cold, windy... I would have gone out regardless. Walking for ages in the cold and dark, until I found somewhere, anywhere, that was open at this hour to sell me booze.

Then I'd have gone through the crazy dance of ""only buying a 4 pack"" to just have to go back again later, buy a bottle of vodka and be done with it.

Wife would find me on the living room floor, still in my coat. Wet from the rain...or my own piss. One of the two.

Thank fuck its not like that today. Honestly. Today I didnt need to travel in the freezing rain to get booze, and for that I'm forever thankful to the kind people of AA that helped me, to help myself

But it made me think. Someone somewhere is doing that crazy back and forth journey. Probably tonight.

Life will take on new meaning.  To watch people recover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness vanish, to see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host of friends - this is an experience you must not miss... Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89

It is through service that the greatest rewards are to be found.  But to be in a position of offering true, useful and effective service to others, I must first work on myself.  This means that I have to abandon myself to God, admitting my faults and clearing away the wreckage of my past.  Work on myself has taught me how to find the necessary peace and serenity to successfully merge inspiration and experience.  I have learned how to be, in the truest sense, an open channel of sobriety.

When the Twelfth Step is seen in its full implication, it is really talking about the kind of love that has no price tag on it.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 106

In order for me to start working the Twelfth Step, I had to work on sincerity and honesty, and to learn to act with humility.  Carrying the message is a gift of myself, no matter how many years of sobriety I may have accumulated.  My dreams can become reality.  I solidify my sobriety by sharing what I have received freely.  As I look back to that time when I began my recovery, there was already a seed of hope that I could help another drunk pull himself out of his alcoholic mire.  My wish to help another drunk is the key to my spiritual health.  But I never forget that God acts through me.  I am only His instrument.  Even if the other person is not ready, there is success, because my effort in his behalf has helped me to remain sober and to become stronger.  To act, to never grow weary in my Twelfth Step work, is the key.  If I am capable of laughing today, let me not forget those days when I cried.  God reminds me that I can feel compassion!

So I should probably have some pearls of wisdom to share. Except I don't really, not even a decent AA style drunkalog because I haven't been to an AA meeting in over twenty-two years.   


I can hardly remember much about drinking because it seems like a lifetime ago. Looking back I can now see the years of signpost ignored, things like my circle of friends shrinking as they grew up. In the semi sane state I'm in now I can't recall how I rationalized the advantages of a barstool lifestyle. I've been thinking about that sobriety date all week and that ""moment of clarity"" expression is my most vivid memory. I'd like to share that story and how I got there.   


Getting to that moment of clarity took me a long time. I would go on the wagon every January 1st and on February 14, 1986, 45 days on the wagon I attended a wedding and drank too much, sleeping at my table by dessert. An old friend at the wedding twelve stepped me, took me out to coffee after the wedding and then to an AA meeting in the morning. It seemed like an easy enough challenge and a method to pacify the girlfriend I took to that wedding, ninety meetings in 90 days and then back to enjoying life. It was very friendly, I was given phone numbers and guidance. As to my atheism I was told that the God in the steps could be an acronym for Group of drunks.     


For three weeks I sat in the back of the room saying to myself ""I never did that"" as others told their stories and closing my ears whenever someone spoke who got there much sooner than I did. It took me three weeks to decide that alcohol was not my problem, my problem was the expense of my drinking habit and I had a better chance of survival if I became a cheapskate drunk. I thought all I needed to do was swear off cocaine. It sounds crazy to me now but back then the cycle after work (I buy three and the bartender buys one) followed by supermarket and liquor store, then cheap white wine and eating at home alone made perfect sense.  


The next couple of years are quite blurry but I do recall that I thought I was doing great. I had a steady job and told myself ""drunks don't do that."" The rent, electricity and phone were paid mostly on time and that was accomplishment enough for me. When payments got very late, getting close to an eviction or having the phone turned off, usually a symptom of going back to cocaine, I'd stop into AA for a week or two with the best intentions but went right back to drinking when I caught up to the bills. Why I never compared my coworkers who were buying homes and having babies to my deadend lifestyle, I guess that's part of the denial. But on those ""sober vacations"" I was hearing things. One memory was a wise drunk that told me ""'Don't say 'I never did  that,' say 'I didn't do that yet.'"" Looking back, the truth is I did almost all of it but I was lying to myself.  


You know that thing about that journey of denial, well the expression goes ""AA in the head and beer in the belly don't mix."" It began creeping into my life. There were several moments of AA induced rational thinking but one day, it was December 7, 1990 I was sitting at my usual barstool by the window watching the world pass by and suddenly I thought about what those passersby had. I realized I wanted that. I probably would have forgotten all about it but the next morning the alarm clock went off, it was Scott Muni discussing the tenth anniversary of the death of John Lennon. I looked at that old clock radio on the shitty old secondhand night stand in my shitty old apartment, nothing had changed for me in the ten years since John Lennon was shot and killed. I began going to meetings for real but, even though I want it, I bought a six pack of tall boys after the Friday December 14th evening meeting. I went to three meetings on December 15, three more the next day, took a coffee commitment on Monday, made three meetings every weekend day and two on weekdays. And then things just started coming together.  


I slipped away when I got into a relationship, first cutting back and then a few years later I lost touch entirely. But if there was no AA for me back then, I think I'd be much better off dead than alive today. Thank you  Alcoholics Anonymous. It was the best gift I ever received in my life.",207,0

From that moment on, I have not had a single compulsion to drink.

And acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation‚Äîsome fact of my life ‚Äîunacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens in God‚Äôs world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life‚Äôs terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and in my attitudes.

Shakespeare said, ‚ÄúAll the world‚Äôs a stage, and all the men and women merely players.‚Äù He forgot to mention that I was the chief critic. I was always able to see the flaw in every person, every situation. And I was always glad to point it out, because I knew you wanted perfection, just as I did. A.A. and acceptance have taught me that there is a bit of good in the worst of us and a bit of bad in the best of us; that we are all children of God and we each have a right to be here.

1391,"""Relapse is part of recovery""",99,kgi2st,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/kgi2st/relapse_is_part_of_recovery/,123,1608418034.0,"So, I might start a shitstorm by posting this, but I have a mini-rant that I need to get off my chest before it becomes an actual resentment (sponsor on speed dial!).

<takes deep breath>

Ok, so, today on another recovery subreddit someone posted about just coming back to the rooms after a pretty nasty relapse--he was sharing this by way of emphasising how devious addiction is and how important vigilance in recovery is. In the comments, someone--who was being genuinely helpful and encouraging--said ""relapse is part of recovery.""

I saw red. I actually said ""fuck that!"" out loud when I read that comment. Relapse is NOT part of recovery. Relapse is part of addiction. People who are in recovery, who are actually working the program and being honest with a sponsor; doing Step work and staying plugged into the fellowship don't relapse.  The relapse STARTS when recovery STOPS. 

But here's my real beef with what I consider to be a rehab industry catch-phrase: I think it gives people an excuse, or at least a mental out, to half-ass their program. After all, if ""relapse is part of recovery,"" then it's all good, right? And to that extent, I think it's dangerous; deadly, even. I've been sober a few 24 hours and I've sponsored dozens of guys. And in that crowd are several men who went back out. And died. So the last thing I want to do--or see other people do--in recovery is normalise relapse like it's somehow the equivalent of working a good program. Do we shame folk for relapsing? Hell no! Can relapse be part of someone's *story?* Hell yes! But is ""relapse part of *recovery?*"" absofuckinglutely not. It's part of addiction. 

So, that's my rant. Thanks for listening, and I appreciate any comments you might have. Obviously this is my opinion and in no way an A.A. principle, but my experience with the Steps points me in this direction.

This is indeed the kind of giving that actually demands nothing.  He does not expect his brother sufferer to pay him, or even to love him.  And then he discovers that by the divine paradox of this kind of giving he has found his own reward, whether his brother has yet received anything or not.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 109

Through experience with Twelfth Step work, I came to understand the rewards of giving that demands nothing in return.  At first I expected recovery in others, but I soon learned that this did not happen.  Once I acquired the humility to accept the fact that every Twelfth Step call was not going to result in a success, then I was open to receive the rewards of selfless giving.

I did the work and stayed willing to try the steps and picked up that phone, sure. But I feel that the Group Of Drunks who so lovingly have guided me and lifted me up deserve the gratitude. 

My first drink was a shitty wine cooler at the age of 11. I remember immediately feeling happy and wanting more. That inner critic and self hatred dissipated as the afternoon wore on. I had arrived. 

My last drink was out of desperation. I stole my roommate‚Äôs collector beer and drank it all in order to feel okay enough to spend time with my best friend. I felt pitiful and incomprehensibly demoralized. I wanted to die every morning when I woke up. 

The next day I made a pact with myself I would finally try this cult called AA and would drink the Flavor-Aid for 30 days. When, not if, but *when* it *didn‚Äôt* work I could kill myself justifiably.

Here I am, 8 years later. I can‚Äôt believe what an incredible group of people I‚Äôve come to love and trust over the years. It‚Äôs shocking how I‚Äôve become comfortable in vulnerability and how easily prayer has become a part of my life. I‚Äôm still not religious but I never feel alone in the universe. 

Sure, I‚Äôve wanted to drink many times. But you people in AA have always been there for me, and I thank you.",162,0

A few days where I almost gave into the lie that I could have a glass or wine or just ‚Äúone‚Äù cocktail but I never gave in. It‚Äôs hard but waking up with regret from binge drinking the night before is harder. Having to explain odd phone calls and jumbled texts is harder and embarrassing. Spending days in bed from being hungover and remedying it with more alcohol is harder. My family and friends are supporting me and I feel I‚Äôve begun to mend a lot of trust in those that matter to me most. 
Also, the weight loss is pretty notable and my face is not swollen from vodka. I look alert and bright. 
I guess I just wanted to share to help someone that might not know where or how to start. Initially quitting made me feel a great loss- like I was saying goodbye to a best friend.

The things I have been able to accomplish to better myself and my future are surprising me and I am PRESENT in my life again.

I‚Äôve been sober for 28 days now and I have been substituting with non alcoholic beers. I really love the taste of beer and the non alcoholic beer fills my cravings.

It should be noted that I was diagnosed with depression around 4 years ago and BPD about half a year ago. 

Right now however, my craving is to numb my feelings away. I feel completely alone. Other than my parents and sister, I have nobody anymore. Part of the reason I decided to quit was the realization that nobody respects me or will take my word as a man, which is understandable, I was always drunk. 

I just want to numb myself. I don‚Äôt even want alcohol, I‚Äôd rather have some percocets or xanex or somthing. 

Anyways that‚Äôs my 2 cents. I‚Äôm staring at the liquor store right now. On the one hand, the alcohol will numb me and on the other hand, I‚Äôll most likely relapse.

I recently turned 29 and the drinking has gotten bad. When I get home I'll instantly pour a glass of wine and just lay in bed and drink the whole thing. On the weekends I'll drink all day because I'm bored. I just can't have one glass. When I start drinking I don't stop until I go to bed or blackout. My whole family is full of big drinkers. When we have parties or even dinners we drink a lot. My therapist told me that if I don't put a stop to the drinking now it's just going to get worse. I've tried to stop drinking several times with the intention of going back to drinking when I have control. This time is different. I'm finally admitting that I have no control when it comes to alcohol. I've been sober for a week and it's been tough. I dream about drinking all night. This whole weekend I craved wine. It's really hard to deal with the anxiety and depression. I'm on 150mg of Wellbutrin and 40mg of Prozac. It's helped a lot but it's still tough. I go on long walks four times a week and try to do a couple of intense workouts too. I've been eating nonstop and smoking weed to help with the anxiety. I don't even like smoking weed but I just don't want to be in my head. I feel like I have a food hangover every morning then I just eat to suppress the feelings.

Meetings have to follow some basic rules in order to call themselves AA meetings, but there's really not a whole lot of standardization in meeting formats or in how they're run. Generally speaking a lot of meetings follow similar formats, but as far as I can tell that's only because people are doing things that have been effective in other meetings that they've gone to. And meetings that aren't effective in helping people get or stay sober stop existing as meetings, because people either relapse or go to different meetings which *do* help them stay sober, and so there's no one around to do the work of running the meeting and not enough people showing up to kick in enough money for rent.

There's no formal training in how to run a meeting. At the local level this whole thing is run by volunteers. And not just *any* volunteers, it's run entirely by alcoholics with varying degrees of recovery and varying outside issues. There's extremely little external oversight over meetings. Meetings don't even have to officially register with the local service office. 

There's no outside source of funds. The whole thing is paid for by the voluntary contributions of a notoriously cheapskate segment of society, and it's pretty much entirely run by the unpaid, uncredited efforts of a group of people which is literally defined by their self-centeredness. It says in the Big Book that the fundamental problem of alcoholics is our self-centeredness, which results in our desire to control everything and make it work how we think it should work. We should be the *last* people on earth who'd be able to pull something like this off.

The very fact that AA meetings even exist is proof that this thing works. If nobody stayed sober people wouldn't keep showing up to volunteer their time and keep the whole thing afloat by kicking in a buck or two at a time, and the whole thing would rapidly collapse.

I'm in Chicago, where there's a couple thousand AA meetings a week (in non-pandemic times, it's kinda hard to figure out what's going on now with Zoom, etc.) If the United States government sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into developing a program to help alcoholics get sober they wouldn't be able to achieve anything close to what we're doing, as a bunch of screwed up alcoholics, entirely under our own steam. It's a program by alcoholics, for alcoholics, entirely run and administered and funded by alcoholics. It shouldn't work. The fact that this thing ever even existed at all, much less has continued to exist and thrive, doesn't even make sense. 

On our own we can barely open our own mail. Generally speaking, we're massively contrary and opinionated people who rebel against whatever we're told to do as our default setting. The fact that, together, we're able to do this at all is *nuts*. That's more of a miracle than anything else that I can think of, AA itself is proof of a Higher Power to me.

1408,Nine Years Today,44,ki9ro7,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/ki9ro7/nine_years_today/,4,1608658044.0,"If there was a room to go to and faces to look out at and people to interact with I might know what I want to say here. I've always been much better ""off the cuff"" and on stage than I am at typing. There is no second-guessing something you've already said out to the world. 

Funny, but that is one thing that has remained a constant to my personality through years of alcohol abuse and the better part of a decade sober: I am much more comfortable in front of a group than I am in the middle of it. 

Alcohol made the people I couldn't stand to interact with bearable and made me the ""life of the party."" At least, I thought I was. Perhaps, and far more likely, I was a tolerable embarrassment, always willing to take one more shot and six more drinks than I should have. 

At this point, it really doesn't matter. I made the decision to get sober and left - quite literally - everything behind. Other than family, no one in my life ever knew the drunk me (I'm still an alcoholic; even my wife, who has never seen me take a drink, knows the alcoholic me). Everyone else was an expendable drinking buddy; someone willing to watch me toss everything away. 

Can't say that I miss any of them and I certainly wouldn't say that it's a good way to get sober. But if it weren't for the rooms, I wouldn't be here. I found the companionship I needed at the time, the guidance, the program and the ability. A staunch atheist, I even found a higher power. This was six years before my son would be born and I would find an entirely new reason to stay sober. My daughter two years later would further cement that desire. 

The path is different for everyone, but that first meeting is prolly always the same - doubt, confusion, anger - the list goes on. The one thing that has always stuck with me, though, was something I heard in my first room: ""The longer you're sober, the better it gets."" That has proved itself true time and time again. 

I was worth it then. The life I have now was certainly worth it. You're worth it, too. Never, ever give up.",44,0

He moved out and dropped a bomb on me that over the 7 years we had been together,  he had a daughter with another woman...

I would cook meals, id notice that I had long phone conversations with friends, family, and strangers.... people I didn't know would call my phone and I had no memory of ever speaking to them. I didnt realize how bad my drinking was until I tried to stop. I failed night after night.

I didn't mesh well with the higher power having control. That the disease controlled me.....

Last year, when I went to detox to withdrawal from mind altering substances, I unknowingly bought a ticket to places and things I thought were unreachable for me. On this journey, I‚Äôve found happiness. Not a fleeting sensation brought on by ‚Äúlove‚Äù or the acquisition of any object, but a sustainable wholeness within myself. I found that elusive self-confidence that for my entire life escaped me. The sacred, apathetic, and nihilistic based thinking has begun dissipating and is replaced with self-worth and care. Not only for myself but for others also.
There is something amazing about coming to the realization that I have something to offer the world, and to be fortunate enough to be of use. It‚Äôs been a wild ride. My mother died from alcoholism; about 5 months into sobriety. I called others and cried in meetings. I needed to be vulnerable. I used to think I was a special snowflake with an immeasurable pain that others couldn‚Äôt comprehend. The truth is I just never talked about the way I felt. As a result, I closed myself off from the world. Through recovery, I‚Äôve found a way to relate to everyone and my world opened up in a way I never thought possible.

There is a lot of work still to be done. I am often lazy, I still vape, and over eat. But as I've seen it's progress not perfection. I've lost 50lbs over this year from light exercise and not eating (as much) ice cream. I signed up for and passed 3 classes (71.8 in spanish but I'm proud of that C).

I've(27m) been sober since Oct. 25th. I often have nightmares where I'm drinking and realize that I screwed my sobriety up. Has anyone else experienced this and found any mental exercises or anything to make them stop? It doesn't affect my day much but does slow me down in the mornings a bit as I wake up a bit anxious. You think maybe it is a subconscious fear of relapse? Or just due to having drank so long? I started drinking when I was 19.,11,0

I am 26F and have been a heavy party/binge drinker since the age of 13. I dont need a drink everyday, but when I drink I become out of control. I dont care about anyone or anything aside from drinking more.. I drink until blackout most every time I get alcohol in my system. It is the complete opposite of who I consider my sober self to be.

To make a longer story short I have been on anti-depressents recently that cause almost immediate black outs. I am never a violent drunk but I ALWAYS hurt myself.. By this I mean fall/trip or cant even walk without assistance. Most recently on Christmas I drank till blackout and fell on my face on a concrete porch. Biting thru my lip, severely bruising my body, I am almost certain I broke my nose as I have black eyes. I feel like I have a concussion as well but have not been to the doctors (This is typical). The embarrassment of having my family see me like this is taking a toll but not as severe as the toll that alcohol is taking on me mentally and physically. I have mentioned to my loved ones that I have a drinking problem, which is followed by the comment ""just stop after a couple"" or ""stay away from the hard stuff"". After every black out I am convinced I have hit rock bottom and need to stop, which keeps me sober about 2 weeks before it happens again. I think alcohol will eventually take my life if I don't stop.

I have an amazing 10 month old daughter (completely sober during pregnancy and 2 months post partum) and an amazing partner and want to be the best version of myself for them.. But when I drink, I have no care of how I could be effecting them.
Can anyone advise me or walk me thru a meeting? Or provide any advice on first steps in becoming sober?? I managed to maintain sobriety while pregnant but cannot seem to maintain it now.. 

Thank you in advance.",13,0

1441,2 Ways To Know You Are Alcoholic (Powerless over alcohol),10,kmjde9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/kmjde9/2_ways_to_know_you_are_alcoholic_powerless_over/,2,1609265014.0,"Alcoholics Anonymous offers 2 tests to find out whether you are actually powerless over alcohol. Powerless is a strong word. It has an objective meaning with a deadly implication. Powerless means you are unable to stop despite *THE NECESSITY* or *THE WISH* to stop (see Alcoholics Anonymous pg 34). I thought this post may be helpful for those who are new to AA or are simply concerned about their drinking and don't know much of what AA is or what it offers.


*""If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the amount you take, you are probably alcoholic."" Alcoholics Anonymous, pg44*


**Test 1** (Alcoholics Anonymous pg.31): Start drinking and try to stop abruptly. This will help you determine whether you can control the amount you take.

**Test 2** (Alcoholics Anonymous pg.34): Make a conscious decision, or an oath, to quit drinking for 1 year. If you are unable to stick to your commitment, you are unlikely able to quit entirely despite a desire to do so. 


You obviously don't have to take these tests if you already know the outcome. I had tried both of these tests on my own by the time I made it to AA. When I read it, I knew AA was talking about me. I was powerless over my drinking and was in a very bad condition. The most powerful desire to stop was of absolutely no avail. 

If this sounds like you, Alcoholics Anonymous goes on to say *""If that be the case, you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual experience can conquer"" pg.44*

By taking the 12 steps, I had a spiritual experience. I was lifted from a state of hopelessness and misery. My cravings were removed from me. If that sounds like a miracle to someone like you - well it is. That's exactly what I'm describing! It was a miracle for me. I can go anywhere and do whatever I want without fear today. My life is amazing today, and I didn't even deserve it. I can't tell you exactly why the 12 steps produce such a powerful spiritual awakening, but I certainly know HOW. 

If you think you are powerless and want relief, please feel free to contact me. I'd be happy to take anyone through the 12 steps.",10,0

I don't know how many he's had, I don't know the alcohol content in the chocolate, I do know that he's heavily involved with AA but I don't know if I should mention the alcohol or not, he seems fine not knowing but I feel so guilty knowing and not telling him.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your advice and sharing your personal stories!! It was very, helpful, and anyone else seeing this is 100% free to share a story they have if this update makes them feel like they ""can't"" or anything along those lines.

I told my mom, rather than my dad directly. I took into consideration his reactions to anything alcohol related in the past, and thought telling my mom would be the best thing to do. SHE didn't even know there was alcohol in the chocolate either, but she took out all alcoholic chocolates.

I did try to do some more looking into the brand we have to see if they have the alcohol content on their website or to see how they advertise themselves overall. ""Purdys"" doesn't directly advertise as alcoholic chocolate, and there's no alcohol content percent on their website or packaging. Some of the names are a solid giveaway of what's in that specific chocolate, but to exactly know why one is labelled alcoholic you have to go to their website and read the description.

I‚Äôm not really sure what my goal is in posting, but I feel I need to make it official to someone else that I am quitting drinking. I don‚Äôt have anyone to support me personally, so trying here. Guess I just need to vent!

I‚Äôve been drinking since I was 14 (so almost 16 years). Sometimes it‚Äôs been hard to admit that I‚Äôm an alcoholic. I don‚Äôt drink all day. Some nights I only have a couple drinks. I make it to work every day and don‚Äôt drink there. But, I drink every night. Some nights it‚Äôs a couple drinks, some nights I black out. Some nights it‚Äôs somewhere in between. I often wake up feeling horribly embarrassed by things I‚Äôve said to people while drunk the night before.

My drinking‚Äôs been a problem for a few years, but this year it‚Äôs hit a new level. My SO of years (and father of my children) left me for the woman he‚Äôs apparently been cheating on me with for years. Then covid hit. Then my dad moved states away. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends, and the few local family members I have aren‚Äôt supportive in the very least. 

New Years was an eye opener for me. My favorite uncle came to my state, and I drove the couple hours up to spend the evening with him. We had an awesome condo right on the beach. I was looking forward to spending time with him and making good memories. But, I don‚Äôt remember most of the night. All I remember is getting so drunk that I cried all night. Ruined my New Years and probably his too dealing with me. Instead of waking up to a fresh new year overlooking the ocean, I woke up incredibly hungover and beyond depressed. I started my year having horrible thoughts even though I was looking at one of the most beautiful places in the world. 

Even tonight, I‚Äôm still hungover from NYE. Yet I have a beer in my hand. I don‚Äôt know what to do to quit and stick with it. I‚Äôve quit before, but it‚Äôs lasted only a few days before I decide I can have just a drink or two. Then the cycle starts again. I‚Äôm terrified to go to meetings for some reason.

I had enough and hit a meeting the next day.

I thought jumping into the program all my problems would be solved. Of course I‚Äôd have a six pack, be rich, and fall in love.

NONE of that happened, but I am happy and this program has restored me to sanity. 

Now I have a daily design for living and have a massive opportunity to hit goals (more realistically saving money... the six pack might not happen lol)

My relationships with my family, friends and complete strangers are incredible. I‚Äôve learned to meet everything with love, patience and tolerance and it‚Äôs a something I never imagined.

I took the suggestions, hit 90 meetings in the first 90 days (more than that), read the book, called other alcoholics, took service positions and most importantly GOT A SPONSOR AND DID THE STEPS. 

It started with not drinking but ended up changing my thinking. If you‚Äôre considering AA as a solution to alcoholism I hope you jump in the pool like I did and just go for it.

Now I have a sponsee who I‚Äôm bringing through the steps. I‚Äôm not only experiencing his growth but I‚Äôm also building upon my program and continuing to grow as a person. 

Best decision I ever made.

It is no coincidence that the very first Step mentions powerlessness: An admission of personal powerlessness over alcohol is a cornerstone of the foundation of recovery.  I've learned that I do not have the power and control I once thought I had.  I am powerless over what people think about me.  I am powerless over having just missed the bus.  I am powerless over how other people work (or don't work) the Steps.  But I've also learned I am not powerless over some things.  I am not powerless over my attitudes.  I am not powerless over negativity.  I am not powerless over assuming responsibility for my own recovery.  I have the power to exert a positive influence on myself, my loved ones, and the world in which I live.

This time is so much different than before. August 28th, I was thrown on a plane and taken to California for rehab. I did sober living, intensive trauma program, every conceivable thing you could do for recovery. I finally had enough. I lived under a bridge for a week, I wasn‚Äôt just drinking. I never thought alcohol was my problem. 

Then I realized: I never skipped a beat when it came to drinking. Every time I was using other drugs, it started with drinking. That‚Äôs when I realized, I‚Äôm not just a drug addict, I‚Äôm alcoholic too. 

There‚Äôs something someone told me at my inpatient. And it‚Äôs stuck with me since. 

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄòDrug Addict/Alcoholic‚Äô on your birth certificate. That‚Äôs not all you are.‚Äù And that‚Äôs helped me through this process. New Years and Christmas was a breeze, in fact, my girlfriends side of the family was drinking and having a party and I just talked to her brother in law and relaxed the whole time. I actually told him that I‚Äôm proposing to her in April. There were no urges to use. 

In the Promises, it says that the desire to drink disappears. I finally have my financial and physical freedom, but more importantly I have my emotional freedom.

I‚Äôm blessed enough to have 6 years under my belt but today I‚Äôm reliving my own worst moments as I think about how that was or could still have been me.  To put it in brief terms, my sister-in-law has admitted she‚Äôs an alcoholic and has stated she wants to quit, though she suffers from multiple cross addictions as well.  My brother has been trying to accomplish this goal by force.  Last night he attempted to take pot away from her and she hit him.  Cops were called and she was arrested for assault.  This sort of story isn‚Äôt unfamiliar to most of us but the circumstances are that she was to start her dream job 7 hours from home tomorrow.  They are in the process of moving away for her to pursue her dream job.  My brother was the sole provider until this point and has left his job to move away to support her dream.  Now that she is undoubtedly losing this job they are left in what can only be described as an absolute wreck.  A mortgage and a rental, half their stuff now out of state, kids in the process of switching schools, no income, an absolute mess that my brother and my family will be left to clean up.  I had expressed my trepidation about their move to my brother stating that as long as she keeps drinking, things will continue to go downhill.  I‚Äôve never so much wished to be wrong, but this disease doesn‚Äôt care about that.  I‚Äôm angry at her but I also empathize with what she‚Äôs going through in a way my family cannot.   I intimately know how she must be feeling and the physical withdrawals she is about to face.  Today I can vividly remember what rock bottom feels like.  Waking up knowing what you‚Äôve lost and the emotional destruction we leave in our wake.  And it‚Äôs made me more grateful than ever that I am sober.  That every day I don‚Äôt pick up a drink is a gift for me and my family and that I need to remember to be grateful for that.

It is shocking, especially the first time you experience it. However, when you think about what's actually going on, it's really quite sad. Imagine how pathetic your life has to be that fun for you is playing pre-recorded audio clips of racial slurs at 12 step meetings. They don't even have the balls to say the stuff themselves. And they can't do it at the big meetings cause they're much more locked down. I mean imagine how shitty and small your life is if that's what you're doing for fun. Pretty pathetic really when you think about. I wonder what else is on the agenda for the night for these losers. I really kind of want to know.

Today marks 365 consecutive 24 hour periods without a drink. That is entirely by the grace of god/power greater than myself, that I still don‚Äôt understand. But what I do understand, is that I am absolutely powerless over alcohol. Today I have no desire to drink, and I am extremely grateful for that. 

I have learned how to be honest, open minded, and willing to learn. I want what you people had, and was willing, and am willing, to go to any length to get it. Over the course of working the steps with my sponsor, I had a few spiritual experiences. One that occurred was after completely step 5, leaning that it was my emotions that controlled my life. Today, my life controls my emotions, and I can accept that I can not control other people, places, or things. 

At step 12, I had a spiritual awakening as THE result of these steps, I began to understand that this is a program for living, and I must use it in all areas of my life. That too be of of service, I can help others; and by helping others, I can help myself. 

Today, I can view triggers as motivators, obstacles as opportunities, and that where there is faith, there is no fear. I still have my struggles, but I now have the tools and resources to overcome them. By living life on life‚Äôs terms, one day at a time, my life is now manageable. 

For those that are new to the rooms, or returning, please, keep coming back; it gets better, it really does. The promises do come true, IF we work for them.

He cannot picture life without alcohol.  Some day he will be unable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it.  Then he will know loneliness such as few do.  He will be at the jumping-off place.  He will wish for the end.

Only an alcoholic can understand the exact meaning of a statement like this one.  The double standard that held me captive as an active alcoholic also filled me with terror and confusion: 'If I don't get a drink I'm going to die,' competed with 'If I continue drinking it's going to kill me.'  Both compulsive thoughts pushed me ever closer to the bottom.  That bottom produced a total acceptance of my alcoholism - with no reservations whatsoever - and one that was absolutely essential for my recovery.  It was a dilemma unlike anything I had ever faced, but as I found out later on, a necessary one if I was to succeed in this program.

So, when faced with Step One, I found it easy to admit that I lacked the power to not drink.  But was my life unmanageable?  Never!  Five months after coming into A.A., I was drinking again and wondered why.  Later on, back in A.A. and smarting from my wounds, I learned that Step One is the only Step that can be taken 100%.  And that the only way to take it 100% is to take 100% of the Step.  That was many twenty-four hours ago and I haven't had to take Step One again.

I would have gotten a 1.75 liter of clear liquor because that would hold me two nights.  A six pack of beer would last me a week, because I'd have only 1 a day before moving onto the hard stuff.   In my family, getting lit up was asking for trouble because I never knew what I was gonna get (and neither did they)!  They said all kinds of mean things to me like, ""I can't stand talking to you when your slurring your words!"" , ""I hate it when you drink brown liquor, can't you switch to wine?"" or ""Oh God, please get away from me"" and  ""Please don't breathe on anyone when you get to work because you reek this morning, it's bad, real bad.""  How dare they.  They gave me a complex because the  next thing  I knew I was driving into work with the windows down in 20 degree weather trying to ventilate my body thinking; is it coming out of my pores or is it my breath?  I kept breathing into my hand to see if I could smell it, before I'd get on the crowded elevator.

HOLD ON NOW!  That's what it USED to be like for 20+ years.  Today it's been almost two years and I don't have to worry about any of that sh!t anymore.  

I can only imagine the negative implications it would have had on my kid if I still had them all ""held hostage"" to my drinking.   If your drinking your way through COVID and reading this because you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, you can get help here.

**Here's a little gratitude list of some good things during COVID that would not have happened if I was drunk all the time:**

>Lost 50 lbs, built a website, ranked green on all my labs, signed up for a 6 month career boot-camp, learned how not to take the bait with a difficult boss, started a careers blog to help people with their resumes and interview techniques, got off cholesterol and blood pressure meds, saved money from not buying liquor, better home-life, way better, woke up on time everyday and felt GOOD, delivered meals to home bound families w/ my kid on Sundays, earned my PMP certification, taught my kid to drive, set some boundaries at work, fixed a bunch of stuff around the house, kept some others sober by leading meetings, read a bunch of books, refinished a table, learned why even my HP didn't like me, gained peace of mind.

You can do it, if you take it serious and do it for yourself - don't let anything stop you.  I came in thinking I would try it for 1 year and learned the challenge was not self-control.  That solving it starts with working on me and transforming my wrong thoughts where I now know how to live sober without the angst and anger that could only be subdued by the bottle, until it didn't anymore.

I started out in AA, then left and came back this past year.  When I came back I reconnected with my previous sponsor and we started working steps again because I felt like even though I wasn't drinking my life was still a mess. 

Since childhood I've had a lot of awful experiences with racism that have left their mark on me. And living through all the civil unrest of this past year has been extremely difficult. It's not enough to make me drink or an excuse to drink. But it is definitely effecting my peace and sanity. I find myself cycling constantly through emotions of anger, sadness, and anxiety.

I included racists, racism, injustice, and a lot of institutions in my resentments. And I'm working on giving this stuff daily over to my higher power but I still feel stuck. Or like I'm not doing something right because the negative feelings I have attached to these experiences don't seem to go anywhere.  

I was wondering if there were any black people here who might have some advice on dealing with racism/discrimination as a recovering alcoholic. My home group is almost entirely white and not necessarily the most sensitive to racial issues which has left me feeling kind of isolated.

I understand that I'm basically venting right now, but I also want for other newcomers and even old timers to see this and remember that **recovery comes first.** One gentleman was at a meeting recently and said even though he's sober his marriage is failing, but he was still sober and that's what counts.

REHAB (Part 1)

I am nervously eating lunch in a caf√© two blocks from the courthouse.  I sit down and eat, but I feel like pacing (which I have been doing now for the previous three hours).  Court restarts at 1:00pm and my case is on the docket.  I have been afraid of this day for four months. The judge that my attorney ‚Äúselected‚Äù didn‚Äôt show today, and my attorney hasn‚Äôt shown yet either.  A quick phone call and he says he is on his way and ‚Äúwill take care of things.‚Äù As I nervously wait, about every fifth ‚Äúcase‚Äù is walked out in handcuffs to go straight to jail.  Every now and then someone is brought in wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and cuffs.  They couldn‚Äôt raise the bail money.  Mine was $800.00 and I could. The charge was DUI #2 (second in 16 months, 0.30 on Intoxylizer) and DWLR (Driving While Licensed Revoked).
 
My case is called and I approach the bench.  I have done this twice before; once when I was 20 years old and spent a night in the London, KY jail.  The other time was when I was 30 years old and was testifying to have wife #1 legally committed to a psychiatric facility. Now I am 50 years old.  This was not the life I had planned. My attorney makes a few remarks and the judge asks me to step forward.  I do not remember what he said, but I blurted out how sorry I was, and how I was planning to go to a rehab facility the next day if he gave me the opportunity to do so.  I was sober that day (had not had a drink in 12 days) and wearing a nice looking suit and tie.  I was polite. I was white.  Years later I wrote an Op-Ed piece on white male privilege that was widely received ‚Äì and also widely reviled.  The judge opined that he had seen some people ‚Äúlike me (meaning alcoholics) turn their lives around with a second chance.‚Äù  I had a glimmer of hope. He then read the sentence ‚Äú30 days in jail SUSPENDED if you complete treatment starting tomorrow, 17 months in prison SUSPENDED ‚Äì any violation of supervised probation will result in automatic activation of 17 month sentence, $500.00 fine, $20.00/month probation fee for two years, $90.00 court costs, forfeiture of car to the state for auction (proceeds to benefit public schools). I am teary eyed, and thank him in a low voice, and walk to the lobby.

I spend that night again in a local hotel in my hometown.  My wife does not want me staying in the house. I don‚Äôt like it, but I accept it.  The next day I am driven four hours to a drug/alcohol rehabilitation center in Virginia.  It didn‚Äôt look anything like what I pictured. I waited numbly in the lobby of the old house that was the main building of the center. My diary notes say ‚Äú‚Ä¶sad and confused. Admitted at 3:00pm. Hugged my father goodbye (first hug I ever had from him).  A patient named Mike showed me around, and my room.  They made me go to an AA meeting that night. Everything was a blur.‚Äù 

The next day I ‚Äúfeel better.‚Äù It‚Äòs Saturday. I go to several group discussions.  I am allowed to call home.  My wife is angry (‚Äúall business‚Äù); She asks ‚Äúdo you have enough structure there?‚Äù I shoot back ‚ÄúThis is no picnic‚Äù and hang-up. That afternoon the group goes to an NA picnic in a nearby park.  I am angry, but went anyway and tried to make the best of it.  I have no idea what I am doing, or why. On Sunday I go to some more groups, and the afternoon is free for visitors to come.  I have none, of course.  Feeling very lonely.  Did I say I have no idea of what I‚Äôm doing or why?

Monday is my first full day. I saw the doc and told everything I could and met my case manger.  Great, I am now a case to be managed. This is not the life I had planned. The next day I learn that I will be moving from the detox inpatient rooms in the old house to the apartments where the patients (residents) stay.  I have no linens and no ride there, but someone finally drives me over.  I arrive at 5:00pm and am met on the steps by one of my roommates who says matter of factly: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to an AA meeting, now.  Come on.‚Äù I drop my bag and go with them. At 7:30 pm I find a frozen noodle dinner in the freezer and nuke it.  This is all new and scary and I am lonely. I meet my four roommates. Friendly enough.

The next morning I meet with my case manger for a ‚Äúpsychosocial.‚Äù  Lots of tears.  She concludes with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the right place.‚Äù I have no idea what she means.  Years later I would learn. I join my ‚Äúgroup‚Äù at 11:00am.   Seven people.  Margaret is crying. I think she reminds me of a ‚Äúsuburban housewife.‚Äù That quick judgment and stereotyping thing is alive and well in me. I later learn she is a respected physician in her community and a drug addict, and she becomes one of my closest friends. Months later after discharge we would meet in Las Vegas for another new friend‚Äôs wedding. This turned out to be the first female friendship I ever had without sex involved.  That‚Äôs a big deal for me. 

In the afternoon Robert is ‚Äúdoing his 1st step.‚Äù I have no idea what that means. Incredibly, he describes a near-death experience from his alcoholism that brought him here, and yet is in total denial about his situation.  And this is his 89th and final day in treatment. He is going home tomorrow-to my home state too.  The next day the group gives him ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù ‚Äì it sounds pretty harsh to me ‚Äì and he is discharged.  I heard that he died sometime within that next year. The next several days involve groups, a meditation class, some light outdoor activities.  That weekend my new buddy Larry and I walk to a shopping center across the street and wander around a Target for an hour or so.  I had never been in a Target before.  Reminded me of Wal-Mart for people with OCD.  Still does.  I am still confused, lonely, sad and have no real idea what I am doing.  I am 50 years old, married with two children (ages 8 and 14), have a Ph.D. and a resume that shouts ‚Äúvery successful professional person.‚Äù  I have no job (fired).  This is my second inpatient rehab in five months (plus a week long residential therapy program, plus a three month day treatment program).  I am feeling a little better physically; however, I am very aware that this is not the life I planned.

Had pretty bad depression for around 2 years and the sauce was of course not a long term solution. Long story short, a few months of therapy, major life changes etc got me to a much better place but was still dealing with depression on almost a daily basis. Doctor eventually prescribed me zoloft and from the first time taking it was immediately completley turned off from drinking, paranoid about the combination of Rx pills and alcohol I guess. That was about a month ago and haven't had any alcohol since, feel so much better. I think I've gained a bit of weight due to the zoloft but also I've been on a very high calorie diet to try and build muscle mass.

By going back in our own drinking histories, we could show that years before we realized it we were out of control, that our drinking even then was no mere habit, that it was indeed the beginning of a fatal progression.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 23

When I was still drinking, I couldn't respond to any of life's situations the way other, more healthy, people could.  The smallest incident triggered a state of mind that believed I had to have a drink to numb my feelings.  But the numbing did not improve the situation, so I sought further escape in the bottle.  Today I must be aware of my alcoholism.  I cannot afford to believe that I have gained control of my drinking - or again I will think I have gained control of my life.  Such a feeling of control is fatal to my recovery.

(It was a very simple jab at her social media use, she didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about when I brought it up). 

Anyhow, I was thinking to myself and realized that my thought process on treating myself and others is very different, mostly thanks to the path AA started me on.

I now instantly recognize when I‚Äôm hurting others to do what I think is positive for me, and try to not. I do it less and less and am more and more compassionate everyday and I think that is key.

I shouldn‚Äôt be an alcoholic because I‚Äôm older.. 
I‚Äôm supposed to be more responsible than this.. I‚Äôm in school, I‚Äôm supposed to be focused on growth.

I screwed up, everyone. To whomever is reading.

I got drunk this past Saturday. I felt invincible for that night, talking like someone else and walking as if the world owed me for my hardship.. 

I freaking screwed up. 

I got drunk to the point where I was riding alongside  with untrustworthy strangers trying to go drink more and was attacked by them. Everyone was drunk.. 

I cannot recall what was said.. but whatever i said, got me punched and robbed.... no phone, keys, wallet.. nothing. This is my fault. I should have been home. I should have not touch Alcohol.. 

I have a huge bruise on my chin. It‚Äôs embarrassing to wake up sober to this.. hide it with the mask.. The guy got me good with the punch, but I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how it got to that point.. Now I‚Äôm just scared, sad, have anxiety, and have stomach pains and regret. I keep replaying that night wishing that I didn‚Äôt just get robbed and hit like that.

When I drink, I drink non-stop. And it‚Äôs affecting my relationship with my family and close friends...

I feel alone with this monster that I‚Äôve become.. I can‚Äôt even look at myself without feeling disappointed..

What is wrong with me? I‚Äôm trying to be sober because being sober is the only thing I know that‚Äôs gonna save my life before something entirely worse happens, and I can‚Äôt afford that.

I feel like I hit Rock Bottom. This is the lowest I‚Äôve ever been..

Everything going on in the world with COVID isn‚Äôt making things better..

So please, help me stay sober. I need some guidance of the sort because I wanna get my life back. I want to sober up like my brother did and fix my life..

The essence of my spirituality, and my sobriety, rests on a round-the-clock faith in a Higher Power.  I need to remember and rely on the God of my understanding as I pursue all of my daily activities.  How comforting for me is the concept that God works in and through people.  As I pause in my day, do I recall specific concrete examples of God's presence?  Am I amazed and uplifted by the number of times this power is evident?  I am overwhelmed with gratitude for my God's presence in my life of recovery.  Without this omnipotent force in my every activity, I would again fall into the depths of my disease - and death.

But I'm doing AA meetings 2-3 times a week and spending time reading the Big Book, another book about forgiveness, and also meditating. Jogging also contributes to my mental health. 

As a bit of a perfectionist, one of the difficult things I find in these early stages is getting the balance right between 1) getting up each day and putting in a decent effort on all fronts and 2) allowing myself the time to rest and heal, because adjusting to sobriety is such an emotional upheaval that some days I feel exhausted. I think I'm getting into a good routine now, but when I'm feeling a bit burnt out I try to remind myself that I'm recovering from an illness and I shouldn't feel guilty if I sleep in or have a bit of a lazy day here and there. I tend to work hard on my career and several other fronts, so every now and then I feel a bit burnt out. 

A quote that I saw recently that really stuck with me is, ""Live the story you want to tell"". I was inspired by these words to live a life of recovery, one of achievements and adventures that I'll want to share years from now. But I want to also be loving life now and living it to the full.

1539,Told My Story at An Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting Tonight...And It Didn't Go Well,75,l11ure,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/l11ure/told_my_story_at_an_alcoholics_anonymous_meeting/,109,1611117543.0,"Hey everyone, 

My name is Tim, I'm an alcoholic and addict. I went to rehab in August 2020 and I've been staying in a recovery house since I was discharged in October. I have 4 months and 22 days sober. 

Two days after completion of rehab, I picked up a sponsor. He recently celebrated 10 years sober. He's been instrumental in helping me through the struggles of early sobriety. Last Tuesday, I started work on Step 4. He is a consistent and incredibly helpful support. I have a superb relationship with him and I'm very grateful for his guidance and suggestions. 

Last month, he asked me to share my story at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that he started chairing. I shared my story twice in rehab, once in a ""Caduceus"" meeting (I'm a healthcare professional and these meetings are basically like narcotics/alcoholics anonymous for other healthcare workers in recovery. It's typically a requirement to attend these meetings in order to maintain a medical license), once when I arrived at the recovery house, and tonight was my fifth time telling my story. 

It was a ""full house."" There were about forty people crammed into a Church basement. I was so nervous that my hands were shaking. I carried a little notepad with me with some bullet points that I wanted to make sure I touched on. 

My story begins at age 17, when I first drank alcohol. Using alcohol progressed into using marijuana, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and Ambien. However, throughout the use of narcotics, alcohol was always a constant issue for me since I was a teenager. I made sure to speak on this throughout my share. I mentioned that alcohol became the single most important thing in my life. This substance was all I thought about throughout every, single day. I was ""hooked."" 

Admittedly, since narcotics are a significant piece of my story, I spoke on my issues with using the aforementioned substances, as well. 

Once I finished my story, and the meeting was opened for sharing, several people in attendance shared that they were very upset with me for speaking about my use of narcotics. These are some of the things that were said: 

""I couldn't relate to any part of your story. Not a word. Nothing at all."" 

""I was judging you 'pretty hard' for talking about narcotics."" 

""If you need to use a notebook to tell your story, you're not speaking from the heart."" 

""Alcoholics Anonymous frowns upon speaking about narcotics."" 

I left the meeting, got in my car, and started bawling my eyes out. I feel like I wasted everyone's time. I feel like I tarnished the tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous. My sponsor said not to worry about it, but I'm a little irked that he didn't give me some guidelines on excluding my use of narcotics from my story. He knows my story better than anyone. I'm also somewhat bothered that none of the members of the recovery house who have heard my story informed me that I shouldn't speak about my use of narcotics. There are members of the community, here, who have over a year sober. 

I'm experiencing a huge mix of emotions right now. I feel shame, guilt, regret, remorse, and a desire to ""shut down"" and never tell my story again. My therapist at the recovery house told me a few months ago that ""shutting down"" is an immature way to address difficult emotions, but I feel like I really screwed up tonight. I was talking to a member of the recovery house who has 15 months sober about this situation and he said that I'm ""making a mountain out of a mole-hill."" He said that, typically, people in early sobriety feel the need to be perfect in their recovery. Nonetheless, I feel really bad about speaking about narcotics at an AA meeting. I genuinely had no idea that this was ""frowned upon."" 

I absolutely love Alcoholics Anonymous. Working this program has truthfully turned my life around. My relationship with my family is one-million-times better since I stopped drinking. Yes, there are significant struggles in early sobriety; notably, I'm 28 years old and all my old friends continue to drink and use drugs. Sometimes, I feel ""left out."" Loneliness has always been an emotion that I struggle greatly with after I endured intense bullying in high school. 

I truly apologize to the Alcoholics Anonymous community. Again, I did not know that my actions tonight would incite this sort of response. I intend to learn from what happened tonight and adjust my story to the crowd at hand. 

If anyone has anything that they'd like to share in support, I would love to hear from you. I feel very ""down in the dumps"" right now. I know; however, that I don't have to drink over this, and I will not use alcohol to cope with my emotions. I feel guilty for disappointing the community that has helped save my life. I had no ill intentions going into tonight's meeting. 

Thank you to everyone who read this post. Thank you for hearing me out. 

Sincerely, 

Tim",75,0

Today I humbly ask my Higher Power for the grace to find the space between my impulse and my action; to let flow a cooling breeze when I would respond with heat; to interrupt fierceness with gentle peace; to accept the moment which allows judgment to become discernment; to defer to silence when my tongue would rush to attack or defend.  I promise to watch for every opportunity to turn toward my Higher Power for guidance.  I know where this power is: it resides within me, as clear as a mountain brook, hidden in the hills - it is the unsuspected Inner Resource.  I thank my Higher Power for this world of light and truth I see when I allow it to direct my vision.  I trust it today and hope it trusts me to make all effort to find the right thought or action today.

Just letting everyone know that I‚Äôm in a better place mentally, and physically I‚Äôm healing one day at a time. But it‚Äôs really tough.. 

I think my body is finally draining out the booze from the hardcore binge drinking from Saturday.. I don‚Äôt feel as groggy, or guilty, or shaky (DTs).. 

I was reflecting and hit an AA meeting on zoom and I felt alright hearing the stories and experiences.. (relieved to know I‚Äôm not the only one who hits rock bottom) 

I was able to cry.. like I haven‚Äôt had feelings.. I‚Äôve been trying to be numb this whole time and I finally let it out at home.. 

I‚Äôm getting my emotions back.. idk it feels so bad at times cause I don‚Äôt wanna deal with them, but I‚Äôm changing that today and writing it out here and on my notebook.

I cried my face off realizing that I have a problem, and getting hit in the face and robbed. That moment hasn‚Äôt left my mind. Like a higher power was teaching me a lesson when the fist hit me in the face.. 

But today, I was able to clean up my place, shave, brush my hair and look like a decent human being and treat my family with kindness and compassion. 

I‚Äôm cutting off people that trigger my alcoholism. Today I got a message from the guy who was there  that night and saw what happened, and that‚Äôs just someone I cannot be friends with most definitely. So I‚Äôd appreciate any tips or advice about cutting toxic connections you guys!

Skipped a day but wanted to check in with you, family. 

So today marks a week since I got robbed.. I let it go, but still hard to forget GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE. (Wake up call, really) My face is a lot better, i look decent again. 

I started my sobriety Monday and my body feels the changes. I don‚Äôt feel as swollen or lofty from drinking, I feel pure!! It feels wonderful not to drink and I can‚Äôt imagine why I didn‚Äôt stay sober like this. I can actually carry multiple conversations and actually be a decent human for once.. and I have all of you to thank, for being there in my darkest hour.

I was a fool to get caught up.. maybe it was my FOMO (Fear of missing out) attitude that lead to my drunken nights in the first place. I reflect just to see the past mistakes of my dumb nights. I don‚Äôt care about losing friends anymore, if they wanna go drink, that‚Äôs on them. I just don‚Äôt wanna take part of that stupid social crap anymore. Why the hell was I trying to fit in? I am the type to go out of my way for people, but that is changing. I am changing. I‚Äôm no longer putting anyone first but myself.

Being sober 5 days is a huge step. I‚Äôm on top of my bills and creating more solutions than I imagined.. I don‚Äôt feel like a bum, in other words. 

 I was told not to run from my problems from my sister, but to instead find a solution that helps me. My solution is writing and sharing my story in hopes that someone reads it, is inspired by it, and learns through my experience rather than learning by GETTING SUCKER PUNCHED IN THE FACE.. lol 

Please guys, don‚Äôt make that mistake. Your life matters, don‚Äôt waste your money on a bottle that you could have invested in a car, a lover, or an actual life. Trust me. I‚Äôve been where you are. Don‚Äôt make the mistake, friends. I miss each one of them, and I realize I tried to console those thoughts instead of dealing with them like the man I know I am. So take my sisters beautiful advice, too. STOP RUNNING. 

I‚Äôm alone, but that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs ok to be lonely sometimes. It‚Äôs ok to talk to everyone some days too. It‚Äôs ok to cry.. We‚Äôre human we all feel pain.. It‚Äôs ok to be happy and laugh by yourself. Fuck the world, man. Sometimes it sucks.. 

It‚Äôs not doing us favors, so do yourselves a favor and don‚Äôt touch the bottle. 

Save a life by saving yourself.

I feel like I‚Äôm only barely starting to scratch the surface of working on my emotional sobriety... 

My family no longer is disgusted by me and has forgiven me to the point where holidays together are fun and light instead of me causing them to be dark and dramatic. 

But I‚Äôm still not as close to my family as I‚Äôd like to be. 

I understand I hurt them a lot and yes they have generally forgiven me. 

But my sister and cousins haven‚Äôt let me back into their inner circle... which makes sense because as I‚Äôm learning more about personal boundaries in my therapy sessions, I‚Äôm realizing that it‚Äôs possible to forgive someone, but sometimes we have to continue to keep our guard up... I‚Äôm sure my sister & cousins still are keeping their guard up. And to be honest, I know I still have many character defects like negativity so my family probably find me hard to be around.

Anyways I love how AA is all about 2nd, 3rd, and 100th chances. I just wish my family of origin were the same way.

I started reading the Big Book a few days ago and so many of those first few chapters resonate. I also became aware of quite a lot of resistance on my part, to cling to drinking and learn how to be moderate.

Before drinking... this was early on, when I probably could have stopped if I wanted to. My teeth were better. My skin was clear. I was young and in decent shape and making it to school and work. In fact I was probably in the best shape of my life, I had spent all summer riding my bike to work. I was finally proud of my body.

I started drinking to relax at night. I never tried to moderate, I just drank until I felt good, and then probably drank more. My tolerance wasn‚Äôt such that I was drinking SCARY amounts but I remember it being like a handle of vodka a week. I didn‚Äôt try to limit the days or times or numbers. I thought ‚ÄúI got this!‚Äù

Now I have cavities and bone loss in my teeth, my hair is brittle and breaks easily, I‚Äôm 70 lbs overweight and it will show when I lose it. 

In asking myself whether I really want to stop drinking, I am forgetting how easily 7 years just... went away. I have been trying to recapture a time when alcohol didn‚Äôt haunt me, because I knew I was better and happier. 

I don‚Äôt like the pickle analogy. But I know you can‚Äôt turn back time or magically become the person you were before the trauma- and the amount of alcohol I consumed was almost certainly traumatic.

If I had shown a bit more temperance, and a bit less arrogance, I would have stopped myself before it started to affect my health.

Now I‚Äôm facing evidence that just *not taking that first drink* will fend off the kind of bender that makes me gain 10 lbs in two weeks, and working the program will solve all the problems I was using alcohol to escape from. 

I‚Äôm afraid to pick up that first chip. I have broken so many promises to myself over the years. I could, with the right structure, cut back and moderate. I‚Äôve done it before, when I slipped from ‚Äúheavy drinker‚Äù to ‚Äúproblem drinker.‚Äù 

But at this point I know my pattern. I‚Äôm falsely confident. I don‚Äôt want to give up control of my life to work the program, but I let drinking take the wheel and wreck my dreams, my body, and my marriage. Giving up control is hard, but I am staring down the barrel of an even harder path- one that we all know leads me straight back to the rooms. Do I really need to test this theory further?",31,0

... A.A. is really saying to every serious drinker, 'You are an A.A. member if you say so... nobody can keep you out.'

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 139

For years, whenever I reflected on Tradition Three ('The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking'), I thought it valuable only to newcomers.  It was their guarantee that no one could bar them from A.A.  Today I feel enduring gratitude for the spiritual development the Tradition has brought me.  I don't seek out people obviously different from myself.  Tradition Three, concentrating on the one way I am similar to others, brought me to know and help every kind of alcoholic, just as they have helped me.  Charlotte, the atheist, showed me higher standards of ethics and honor; Clay, of another race, taught me patience; Winslow, who is gay, led me by example into true compassion; Young Megan says that seeing me at meetings, sober thirty years, keeps her coming back.  Tradition Three insured that we would get what we need - each other.

The purpose is for me to read back when I crave alcohol, hopefully a reminder to myself why I want to go sober. (I have unfortunately relapsed since writing this, I went 5 days sober) 

I awake fully dressed, the television on. Xbox controller in lap with my headset still connected. my favourite songs still playing. Taking the headset from my head I gently place it next to me. I‚Äôm sat upright I slept like this. My head spinning. I feel weak, emotionally fragile and sick. I compose myself. pulling myself up from the pit I‚Äôve formed in my bed. A sudden bang makes me jump, the sound of the bottles being knocked over. I grab my phone checking the time, 5.45 am. A distorted memory of being up till 2 am. I haven‚Äôt slept I have blacked out. I hold my head in my hands and let out a stream of tears.

I hurry downstairs the thirst mixed with the awful feeling in my head leads me to chug glasses of water. It hurts my stomach, my throat. I rush back to my room, attempting to straighten my head out. I jump on my exercise bike, water at my side. I need to burn 500 calories. It‚Äôs nothing but pain. I sit crying as my body struggles to pedal the bike. But I do it, I get to 500 calories. At this point, I feel completely drained but I must get ready to go about my day, I have work. I get ready, practising my fake smile, my fake persona. I can‚Äôt go into work displaying the pure pain I feel within. The mirror allows me to check myself over, rehearsing my facial expressions. I grab my bag and I head to work. 

I don‚Äôt drive so I‚Äôm walking. Where do I place my eyes? I‚Äôm looking at my environment everyone looks happy. There are people jogging smiling as they pass, dog walkers too! So I smile back. Some say good morning, they get a faint ‚Äúmorning‚Äù back. Do they think I‚Äôm rude? I think about how they view me from my quiet miserable sounding reply, my fake smile followed by a stare at the ground. My head is spinning I feel slightly drunk still. A panic attack begins to form, I hurry up almost slightly jogging head hung low rushing. Upon arrival, I perk up. My work colleagues seem happy to see me, so I smile I laugh I joke. Inside I just want to cry. The shift goes very slow the effort I put into faking my happiness further damages me. That night I repeat out of emotion? it has become a vicious cycle. I end up spending huge amounts of time feeling unwell‚Ä¶ I still continue. I watch as my mental health crumbles‚Ä¶ I still continue. I abandon goals‚Ä¶ but I still continue. 

A large portion of my time is spent asking myself why I let it get this bad, why can‚Äôt I be happy like everyone else, why my relationship with alcohol is toxic and harmful. This type of thought leads to nothing but further cravings of escapism. I‚Äôm off of work taking time for myself. It‚Äôs my 3rd day sober‚Ä¶ I feel somewhat refreshed, positive. But that desire to drink, the pure need to escape still exists. I feel embarrassed, somewhat alone‚Ä¶ just hoping that I can stop continuing.",11,0
1569,Someone at my meetings talk about me to her collague/my best friend,12,l6d71l,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/l6d71l/someone_at_my_meetings_talk_about_me_to_her/,23,1611778176.0,"Hey y'all. 
I'm not gonna get into details about myself, let's just say I'm struggling with sobriety. I'm going to meetings and get other treatments as well.
Every Tuesday, there's a meeting that I attend, where we read from the Big Book and reflect upon it. These past 2 weeks I missed the meetings due to personal reasons (illness etc.)

In this group, there's a lady who apparently is a collague of my best friend (I found out today), who has been talking about my absence from the meetings and whatnot with my best friend (her collague). Mind you, we live in a VERY small town, basically everyone at least know OF everyone. Since my best friend knows I attend these Tuesday meetings, it wasn't hard for her to realise her collague was talking about me. 

Collague was saying things (without mentioning my name but damage is still done), that I've been absent for a couple of meetings and so on. (Also, one of those past Tuesdays, I skipped the meeting because I was WITH my best friend, so honestly wtf?) My best friend isn't even an alcoholic or anything, so this collague shouldn't even tell her ANYTHING about our meetings. So my friend, when she called me today, asked me about this and she kind of let the name of her collague slip (though that's not confidential, really, I'M the one who can't tell names of people or anything that goes on in AA) and now I'm just beyond pissed. 

I texted my sponsor (who also go to these meetings) and she said that this lady had asked her about me and even said she'd tell my best friend because she cares a lot about her and she's worried that she'll hurt because of my absence from the meetings, apparently not even giving two Fs that AA is ANONYMOUS. I get even more upset about this as I'm typing this. 

How do I handle this? I could really use some advice here because right now I feel like I never again want to attend any meetings at all around here. When an alcoholic, it really sucks to live in a small town. 

(Sorry for possibly bad grammar/spelling - English isn't my first language and I'm upset.)

*Update (also in comments): So I talked to my sponsor last night and found out this lady had (prior to the meeting this past Tuesday) specifically asked her about me, saying she works with my best friend and she'd tell her I missed meetings because she cares a lot about her. Also, apparently, she wants to set my bff up with any of her sons?! Perhaps she feels that our moving in together is threatening her match making, I don't know and I don't care. My sponsor sternly told her during their conversation that it is NOT okay to talk about members of the groups with people outside, but apparently she went ahead anyway. 

My sponsor is amazing, she got me to calm down. It seems that lately (as in, since I been in recovery) my only reaction to anything is a major overreaction. It's hard, but I do accept it's part of recovery. We'll have an ethics (? don't know what you call it in English, sorry) meeting next Tuesday to talk about the traditions and especially the part of AA being anonymous. Reminders are always helpful.

Still the disease and insanity took control and I was spiraling out of control.

Before that I thought alcohol was the most disgusting thing ever. I didn‚Äôt even go to my first bar until I was 23, it was like love at first sight. But this week, it all changed. Tuesday morning I had VIOLENTLY thrown up because I am such a heavy drinker, I just thought vomiting in the mornings were the ‚Äúcure‚Äù but boy was I wrong. I pulled all my abdominal muscles... so I had convinced myself I was fine & continued drinking for the next few days.

Then yesterday came. I woke up, threw up and went to work. Sitting there for 2 hours I started to feel what was the worst pain I‚Äôve ever felt in my entire life. I still thought it was my muscles, then I realized how bloated I was & how bad it hurt, not like it was just a pulled muscle..

I decided to go to the hospital but it took a lot of convincing. After a few hours in the ER getting tests done & a bunch of pain meds, they told me I have Pancreatitis. From my extreme heavy drinking, which I thought wasn‚Äôt a problem because I know so many people who do the same thing.

The doctor told me by the time I‚Äôm 30, my liver and kidneys will be shutting down if I keep going at the pace I was.

But this is it, I‚Äôm truly quitting. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this pain on anyone in the world. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people here can relate. But this was a huge eye opener, I will not be touching a drop after all that I‚Äôve been through. 

They aren‚Äôt letting me go home until Monday & I haven‚Äôt ate or drank anything since I‚Äôve been here & they still won‚Äôt even let me have water. I‚Äôm hooked to IV‚Äôs all day & night. This is not fun. Please be careful and tell your friends the same.

I actually tried to attend a secular/agnostic-focused meeting today, and couldn't connect for some reason so figured I'd ask here.

Long story short, I've been going to AA meetings on zoom for about 2 weeks now. People are really welcoming, and I definitely get something out of each meeting. That said, I decided to read Ch4 *We Agnostics* because I'm agnostic and thought it would help me interpret the whole higher power thing in a way that doesn't rely on God.

I think [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/hcwz1i/problems_with_we_agnostics_and_sponsees/fvj4xu4/) by /u/philip456 really captures my same experience.

In addition to being agnostic about God, I'm not spiritual in any way - don't believe in the power of nature, karma, or even a soul to be honest. I'm trying my best to be open about things, but I also feel like prayer might go against my ""beliefs."" Like it almost seems as if I'm being untrue to myself if I pray. That said, I actually really enjoy meditation, so maybe that's an alternative?

My main questions are:

1. I've been quiet about my beliefs at meetings so far, would it annoy people or go against the grain if I talked about this stuff?

2. Would I be able to complete the 12 steps?

My life was in shambles due to my drinking and terrible behavior that came along with it. I had become an every day drinker, and things were seriously out of control.

A couple months later I'm getting out of a 28 day program, which shut down two days after I completed due to covid. I remember being in there watching the news kind of not really knowing the full implications on how different the world was going to be.

Everything I had planned to keep my recovery on track was closed when I left treatment. AA had shut its doors, and it would have been easy I think to just go back to how I was. I got really lucky though, I bumped into an old timer from my home group and he told me about ""coffee"" they had every day. So I started going, and getting to know these guys, and laughing with them and enjoying being sober. Eventually the meetings opened up and I kept going.

Now after a year I'm at the head table my girlfriend is there (didn't think that would work out) and I'm listening to these people talk about how my story and honesty has given them hope too. It was one of the best experiences I've had. 

This year was awesome, it wasn't always easy, I did think about drinking. But I don't want to be that selfish, self centered, person today. In very far from perfect, but if I don't drink and keep going to meetings I've got a shot.

Thanks to you on this sub too. I don't post often but I do creep every day ü§üü§üü§ü",110,0

The unity of Alcoholics Anonymous is the most cherished quality our Society has...  We stay whole, or A.A. dies.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 129

Our Traditions are key elements in the ego deflation process necessary to achieve and maintain sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous.  The First Tradition reminds me not to take credit, or authority, for my recovery.  Placing our common welfare first reminds me not to become a healer in this program; I am still one of the patients.  Self-effacing elders built the ward.  Without it, I doubt I would be alive.  Without the group, few alcoholics would recover.  The active role in renewed surrender of will enables me to step aside from the need to dominate, the desire for recognition, both of which played so great a part in my active alcoholism.  Deferring my personal desires for the greater good of group growth contributes toward A.A. unity that is central to all recovery.  It helps me to remember that the whole is greater than the sum of all its parts.

Recently I made a post about the slogan ""Keep coming back"" ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/l5bcwv/keep_coming_back/)).  Summary: Keep coming back starts with AA meetings, but it applies to so much more than that, too.  It's about how we face the challenges of life.  It's a deeper message of perseverance.

Today I noticed a family friend had posted about how she never gave up on herself and how wonderful that is.  Firstly, let me say that it's not my intention to take her inventory.  But I do think there's a reason we say ""stick with the winners"".  It's OK to look at someone and say to yourself, ""hmm, no, I don't want what they have"".  We don't need to express that opinion to that person, or to anyone,  but I think it's totally fine to hold it.

Last I heard about this friend, her life is really not going well.  Drinking, too.  So it surprises me that she's so enthusiastic about not giving up.  It made me think:

It's not *just* about not giving up.  It's not *just* about ""keep coming back"".  You have to apply your efforts in the right direction.  If something isn't working, try something else.  A karate teacher once told me that doing the wrong thing 1000 times is not on the path to doing it right.

So if meetings alone isn't working, get a sponsor.  If having a sponsor isn't working, work the steps (I recommend both of these things anyway).  If working the steps isn't working, try another sponsor.  Try another run through.  Hell, try another program.  Anything, but if something isn't working, keep coming back, sure, but *fix* *it.*

When my karate teacher first told me that, I got overwhelmed.  The feeling of personal responsibility was too much for me, and I began to doubt myself.  But what helped me was realizing that I don't have to apply my efforts in a direction that wasn't meant for me.  Karate, in the end, wasn't for me.  I stopped training.  So I didn't succeed at that, but I did succeed in other areas of my life that were truly fulfilling to me.  One of which was sobriety and healthy living.

So as a minimum: keep coming back.  But as they say, ""it works if you work it"".  So it's not just about perseverance.  You have to work it.  You've got to find a way.

With my HP on my side I've always found it manageable.  Difficult at times, but never more than I could handle.

Best wishes to all and thanks for letting me share.",22,0
1583,Woke up today grateful to be alive. This is my rock bottom. I‚Äôm a mess.,11,l9t5v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/l9t5v8/woke_up_today_grateful_to_be_alive_this_is_my/,20,1612148544.0,"I‚Äôm writing this coming from the worst of possible places I have ever been in. Today marks the *worst* day of my life. And it‚Äôs no ones fault but my own. 

I was sober 7 months from drugs and alcohol. I thought that having a few drinks here and there wouldn‚Äôt hurt. I thought I was doing so well managing my addiction. That a few drinks here and there was fine. Boy was I so wrong. 

A year later I‚Äôm worse than I‚Äôve ever been. Struggling with BPD doesn‚Äôt help this. It triggers me even. I‚Äôve lost so much this year. Four people to death, my job due to covid, my boyfriend. My life. I drank to cope. And I used because I drank. It never made me feel better. It just helped to mask the pain and depression. I remember at times not leaving bed for days. 

Last night felt like the last night of my life. I was drinking alone at home and decided to go to a friends house. I shouldn‚Äôt of gotten in that fucking car. But I wanted to pick up my fix. I was too drunk to drive. It‚Äôs the dead of winter here. Roads have ice everywhere. I turned a bend too fast and lost control over a sheet of black ice. I don‚Äôt remember how it all happened but I remember losing control because I wasn‚Äôt in the mindset to drive. 

My car flipped twice over and did a 180. When I came to I was being pulled out of my car, blood, glass, everything in pieces. I was out on a stretcher and rushed to the nearest hospital. I remember seeing my car and thinking that it was one of those car accidents ‚Äúpeople need to take a second look at because it was *that bad*.‚Äù When people wonder if the person in the car made it. When I arrived at the hospital I received my first DUI and was placed under arrest for driving intoxicated. I wanted to be mad but I was so grateful to have my life. I‚Äôve driven drunk so many times and have always been fortunate to never even come close to any kind of an accident. Not this time. 

It only takes once.

The ER physicians said I was lucky my ribs weren‚Äôt crushed the way my car flipped. That I must of had a guardian angel looking over me. I came out with minor injuries (deep bruising, some cuts and scrapes and a pulled shoulder ligament). I can barely sit up I‚Äôm in so much pain. And this marks the day I lost everything. 

My car was my only source of anything I had left. I used it to try and get a new job, to drive my daughter to school, to get groceries. I just bought it before I got laid off in November. I remember looking at it as I was being pulled away on the stretcher. Roof caved in. Windows smashed. Blood everywhere. This was my life.

I can‚Äôt stop crying today. I‚Äôm so lost and confused. I don‚Äôt have anything left and I have nothing to lean on. I‚Äôve never felt so low. I couldn‚Äôt even speak to my own 11 year old because I feel such shame. Anyone I still have is so upset with me. I see how I hurt them. How I hurt myself. 

I am broken. Mentally, physically and emotionally. Today was the first day in my life I decided I need to go into a rehabilitation centre. Because I‚Äôve never had the strength to pull this off alone. I never had the will. And I never took this seriously enough. I‚Äôm angry with myself for having THIS... my life flashing before my eyes to want to change. I need serious help. I hate my thoughts right now. I keep replaying all this in my head. The accident is on repeat. The hospital. Everything. 

I keep wishing I died because I don‚Äôt deserve anything I have and I don‚Äôt want to deal with digging out of how deeply I‚Äôve fucked myself, my life and others lives up. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this is triggering anyone. I needed to let this out. I want someone to hug me and wipe away the constant stream of tears off my face. My eyes are now burning as much as my hands are from the broken glass. I just want this all to end and go away.",11,0

First of all, I want to thank all of you for all of your support and for anyone who's reading this. Honestly, if it wasn't for the AA community, I'd probably be dead or drinking myself near to it. 

I'll give you all some context, I'm (17f) in week 2 of outpatient rehab and almost to week 6 of being sober. I want to like this, I really, really do, but I hate being sober. I vehemently cannot stand being sober. Everything is so boring. I miss being able to down a stolen bottle of vodka and not have to think so hard for so long about everything. 

That being said, I WANT to be sober. I know what my life would look like down the line if I didn't do this and I'm resisting the inevitable future that I'd have which is unemployed with no friends and no job or college prospects. I'm trying everything I can when I'm in those moments where I crave the alcohol (meditation, yoga, crying, taking a walk, talking to someone, working) but I can't stop thinking about it. It's like I'm on a hamster wheel going around and around and around with work and school and keeping busy but my life is so mind numbingly boring that I feel like my brain is actively eating itself. It doesn't help that I'm so young and I feel like I have the title **ALCOHOLIC** over my head when I talk to people I know who know my situation. 

At this point, I honestly don't know what my willpower is even like these days, because if someone offered me a drink I might take it. That scares the shit out of me. 

Any guidance would be more than appreciated. Thanks!",11,0

We needed to ask ourselves but one short question.  'Do I now believe, or am I even willing to believe, that there is a Power greater than myself?'  As soon as a man can say that he does believe, or is willing to believe, we emphatically assure him that he is on his way.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 47

I was always fascinated with the study of scientific principles.  I was emotionally and physically distant from people while I pursued Absolute Knowledge.  God and spirituality were meaningless academic exercises.  I was a modern man of science, knowledge was my Higher Power.  Given the right set of equations, life was merely another problem to solve.  Yet my inner self was dying from my outer man's solution to life's problems and the solution was alcohol.  In spite of my intelligence, alcohol became my Higher Power.  It was through the unconditional love which emanated from A.A. people and meetings that I was able to discard alcohol as my Higher Power.  The great void was filled.  I was no longer lonely and apart from life.  I had found a true power greater than myself, I had found God's love.  There is only one equation which really matters to me now: God is in A.A.

I have 90 days sobriety.  I have been going to an intensive outpatient program that lasted a couple months and now I go to that recovery group once a week along with a one on one session with my recovery therapist.  I have so much shit going on on top of that.  I‚Äôm a stay at home mom, I also work part time, and I‚Äôm usually exhausted as fuck.  

Well so far I personally feel like my progress has been awesome.  I am getting better at setting boundaries, communicating and relationships, hobbies...etc.  overall more peaceful and content with life.  Cravings have subsided.  Making sure I‚Äôm not on the pink cloud.

Anyway so I got temporary sponsor 3-4 weeks ago.  We have a lot in common and at first she seemed like the perfect fit for me so I just kept going with it.  

The last couple weeks have just seemed too intense for me.  When we first started I already felt like I had done steps 1-3 so those went quickly understandably.  But since then I feel like I am being rushed through the steps and pressured to go to meetings all the time.  I feel like my life does not permit that and I don‚Äôt like how she implied that I am not going enough by telling me ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you in forever and this needs to be your #1 priority‚Äù.  It is my #1 priority but I am also trying to maintain a balance in my life or I feel like I will go nuts.  And right now I feel like I am doing just fine in my recovery.  

I did steps 4 and 5 this week and she said steps 6 and 7 come immediately after, yet I feel like I am having trouble letting go of all this shit.  So I called to talk about tho and she just seemed really annoyed with me when I was telling her this and she was just like ‚Äúso what‚Äôs your question‚Äù like talking over me and rushing me through the conversation.  Then she told me to be patient with myself but at the same time told me I need to get the steps done ASAP if I want any relief and to rewrite my life story and redo step 4 with her right away. 

I am trying to keep an open mind with her.  I can‚Äôt tell if she just talks a certain way or if she is annoyed with me.  Maybe she just wants me to get relief?   I just wish I was dealing with someone a little softer around the edges and less intense.  She goes to multiple meetings a day and sometimes I wonder if she thinks that everyone should be doing that.  I am so new at all this and don‚Äôt really know what to think.  Advice please.",10,0

I'm just over 6 months sober and am very happy to be living a sober life. 

But about a month ago I got in to a deep depression and did almost everything wrong. I stopped going to in person meetings, zoom meetings, calling and texting my AA fellows and support, stopped eating, stopped praying and worst of all didn't tell my sponsor how I was feeling. 

This led to a big fight with my wife where she kicked me out of the house for a few days. Thank god I didn't drink but I came close a few times. It was a huge wake up call to how fragile my sobriety and peace of mind is and how important that tools and connections I have because of AA are.

I came clean to my sponsor and AA friends. My sponsor kicked my butt and got me back in to meetings and calling fellows and praying daily. I've apologized to my wife and started some new counseling that I've needed for a while. 

I gotta say, coming back from the brink like that has made me extremely grateful for AA, the recovery community, my new found spirituality and my sobriety. They are all things I never want to take for granted again.

Thank you all and have a great day,

So I called in another friend, who lives nearby, to fetch me a bottle so that I can taper off safely. Kept going half as much every other day, until I am 5 days sober today. I'm still shaking lightly, but sleeping, eating, doing house chores. I found a special interest AA group to be my home group, went to two online meetings with them (they are moving, so no face-to-face for another week or two) got a temporary sponsor, working and PMing all day two days in a row, took in two meetings at InTheRooms today, and per my home group's and sponsor's insistence am going to a face-to-face closed meeting with another group only 16 minutes walk from my place! I'm slightly pink-clouding, I know it won't last, but I'm planning 90 meetings in 90 days, live when possible, online when not. Sponsor told me to start doing steps 10-11 now as best I can, it's a crutch that will help me stay sober while I'm starting the program, so I'm completely doing that. Alcoholics Anonymous is the most amazing fellowship I've ever encountered. And the Reddit sub is amazing too. Hope I'm welcome, happy to be here. Have a good 24 :)",32,0

I said, ""What makes you think you can keep doing the same things you did before and get a different result this time?

It is primarily folks in their late 40's and 50's, of which I fit in.  It is friendly and welcoming, but it seems the same basic 12 people speak every time.  In that regard it is a bit cliquey.  What annoys me most is the overall negativity and sameness of the shares.  Everyone has their catch phrase to announce their alcoholism and then they proceed to speak about ""back in my drinking days"" type of stories when ""I wouldn't listen"", ""I was at rock bottom"", and ""they told me to shut up and listen"".  These are all valid reflections but honestly it gets so tiresome to listen to.  

How can you have a bad day everyday?  Did nothing positive happen in your life today?  Aren't you thankful and happy for another 24?  Must you tell us how you refer to your higher power as Leon, which is some cutesy acronym?

So, with my 26th birthday approaching, it‚Äôs about that time of the year where I start reflecting on my life, getting sad that I‚Äôm getting older. This year though, I started thinking about how much of a difference 365 days can really make, and what I‚Äôve done with them. Last year, I relapsed on my birthday. Today makes 75 days I‚Äôm honestly sober, off of everything. I was looking at pictures and videos of my last birthday and just... wow (a disappointment in myself wow). In the past, when I looked back at pictures/videos, and those people weren‚Äôt part of my life today, I used to feel really hurt, like I was unlovable and unworthy of true friendship or relationships. I don‚Äôt feel that way today. One thing that always kept me relapsing was the nouns- people, places, and things. And even though the faces were different, I always kept the same type of people around me. It‚Äôs not their fault- I‚Äôm fully aware that I relapse because I am an alcoholic that used to refuse to accept 1. that I am an alcoholic, 2. my share of responsibility, and 3&4. I never built a solid foundation in sobriety, nor a sober network. I justified the fuck out of my drinking, ‚Äúit‚Äôs my birthday, I haven‚Äôt drank in so long, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm fine now.‚Äù And then boom I‚Äôm blacked out waking up the next day like fuck, another birthday I won‚Äôt remember. I‚Äôm grateful this year will be a sober birthday. I‚Äôm grateful that whoever celebrates with me, will 1. Be my family, the people that have stuck by me no matter what, and 2. Sober friends. 5 years ago, you could not get a PEEP out of me. I had no idea how to be a person without a drink or substance. I didn‚Äôt know how to have a conversation. I was so afraid that if I opened my mouth, I would just break down and start sobbing uncontrollably. The most I could say was a lie; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing good, you?‚Äù. Now, you can‚Äôt get me to shut the hell up. I‚Äôll talk anyone I vibe with‚Äôs ear off, sew it back on, and keep talking. I love connecting, laughing, and building substantial bonds with sober friends today. I still have a hard time being vulnerable with people, but I make a conscious effort to tell people how I‚Äôm really doing today, whether it be good, bad, or indifferent. And how lucky am I that there is a whole fellowship of people, that I can be who I truly am and not worry about conducting myself in compliance with social norms? That shit sucked! I was always watering myself down to fit into a bottle I never even belonged in! And with as long as I have been in and out of the program, it‚Äôs like something finally clicked in my head 75 days ago where i was just looking in the mirror and I said, ‚Äúkid, what are you doing? You know this isn‚Äôt you. You‚Äôre better than this. Did you forget why you started trying to get sober in the first place? Drop the dead weight and take your ass back to AA.‚Äù And I fucking did. It wasn‚Äôt easy, it never is, but I was finally ready. Finally done. Finally graced with the gift of desperation. I got a new sponsor, I committed to doing step work with her weekly. I committed to making meetings. I committed to taking the suggestions I never tooK before because I was stubborn and wanted to do things my way- which never ever worked. I committed to being honest. Most importantly, I committed to investing in myself because I finally believed that I was worth it, and there was a time where I hated myself and thought I deserved the shitshow of a life I had, but today I love myself enough to stay sober for me. I choose me every day. I choose life. And that right there, is the best birthday gift I could give myself. Another chance at life. And when I do it for myself, I give my mom the gift of having her daughter back. My grandma gets her grandchild back. My little cousin gets a big cousin that he respects and sets a good example. My dog doesn‚Äôt run and hide when I walk through the door anymore. My house isn‚Äôt one of constant anxiety- how is she gonna come home today? Is she gonna come home at all? When I thrive in sobriety, everyone around me smiles in my light, but I pray I never forget that when I pick up, everyone gets touched by the darkness of my chaos too. I dunno I felt like I just had to type that all out, and who better to share it with than you folks, who I know are going through it too. If you are someone that relapsed more than once, don‚Äôt give up, you‚Äôre not less than. If you‚Äôre struggling to stay sober, please stay and don‚Äôt give up. If you do relapse, please come back. Let me be some sort of testament that one day, it will finally click for you too, sobriety is worth the hard work, and it will get better. You‚Äôre worth it and you deserve it, do the hard work.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 68

All of my character defects separate me from God's will.  When I ignore my association with Him I face the world and my alcoholism alone and must depend on self-reliance.  I have never found security and happiness through self-will and the only result is a life of fear and discontent.  God provides the path back to Him and to His gift of serenity and comfort.  First, however, I must be willing to acknowledge my fears and understand their source and power over me.  I frequently ask God to help me understand how I separate myself from Him.

It was right here a minute ago...,32,litdoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/litdoj/where_did_that_resentment_get_to_it_was_right/,10,1613191370.0,"I had an interesting experience with a resentment today that I've been chewing over, and I thought I'd share it here.

I'm divorced. It was needlessly drawn out and unpleasant, and by the end of it I was basically just staying focused on making sure that I didn't do *anything* that might result in me having to make amends to my ex later on. I was praying for him, and it did help, but in hindsight I still had quite a lot of resentment simmering under the surface. Basically what made it possible for me to walk away feeling okay was knowing that I got sober and he did not. I felt like I'd been royally screwed but I was having the last laugh, more or less.

I had to email my ex this week about a lingering loose end that we need to tie up. I was really dreading this because I was anticipating him dragging his feet and making me get my lawyer to file something with the court to make him do it. I talked with my sponsor about it and she encouraged me to pray for him, and also to remember that I don't know what the outcome is going to be. 

So I emailed him, and he wrote me back today and basically seemed agreeable about the whole thing. It was such a relief, but I also realized that I didn't feel any resentment towards him. 

My cat, which is a cat that I adopted with him, has taken to chewing on styrofoam when he can, and not styrofoam which has ever been in contact with food, just straight up styrofoam. This afternoon he dug into a bag of garbage I had on the floor while I was working on a project and pulled out a piece of styrofoam and started chewing on it before I could stop him. When it happened I had a sudden desire to mention it my ex if he emails me again, because he'd get a kick out of it. 

We still haven't wrapped up this loose end, and frankly I'm still not entirely sure that he won't end up making me go the lawyer route, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that my resentment is gone. I didn't realize how much I was carrying around, but now it's just... Not there. I don't feel the anger I used to feel. And what happened in the past doesn't really matter much anymore. It doesn't affect my life today. It doesn't affect me. I have what I need. I have the life I want. I'm okay. And I sorta just don't care.

So the praying thing worked. I've written inventory on this and shared it with my sponsor a couple of times, and that's no doubt a part of it, but it was praying for him which made the difference. I don't know if it helped him, but it helped me. And I'm glad to let go of that resentment. It's like drinking was - I thought that it felt good at the time, but now that it's gone, it's a relief to be rid of it and I feel so much better. And I can see my ex's humanity and just basically have a sense of detached goodwill towards him, which is nice.

Anyway, that's what I've got. Thanks for being here, and I will keep coming back.",32,0

Every day my first choice when I wake up is whether or not I‚Äôm going to pick up today or not. Today is one more day I decided that, no matter what, I‚Äôm not going to pick up.
.
With a move literally across the country currently going on, selling our house we love here in CA to move to NC so I can attend law school, an active lawsuit with a former employer, trying to buy a house 3,000 miles away, our lost dog missing for 4 days, some difficult relationships with family members to try & navigate, & all the other random things life throws at you (AND in the middle of a pandemic!), everyone who stays clean & sober every day is a damn miracle.
.
Sitting with uncertainty & in discomfort is so hard. Feeling helpless & lacking control is frustrating. People you thought you could trust disappoint you. And sometimes all I can do is sob, talk to my Higher Power while blubbering & incoherent, not knowing what to do but trusting He does. (That happened this week.) The sole thing I have control over is whether I pick up. And when I choose not to, that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm able to see things come together, the light illuminates the next step & the miracles start to happen. They happen all the time, but my heart is now in a place where I can recognize & appreciate them.
.
We all struggle & buffer, trying to escape in our own way. My way just happens to be drugs & alcohol. But no matter how hard, how many times we stumble or make a mistake because we‚Äôre human, we can try again. And your life will be better than you can possibly imagine. We all deserve happiness & there are no shortcuts, just hard work but, man, is it worth it.",110,0

I thought..... you won't catch me dead in some church basement with a flickering, florescent lightbulb, hunched over in a folding chair talking about my feelings to a group of strangers. F@##%# that!

So when it dawned on me I had a drinking problem, I, of course, tried to get sober on my own. I read every self-help book under the sun, listened to every podcast, etc etc. 

But nothing stuck. 

Finally, one morning while I was hungover, feeling ashamed and hopeless, I dragged my ass to an AA meeting in town. 

And I'll tell you what - I have never felt so inspired, comforted, and understood in my life. I couldn't believe how raw and honest everybody was, but also.... happy? At peace? Yes, I was in a dingy church basement, but there was so much laughter! It gave me hope. 

So I kept coming back. 

I got a sponsor. I worked the steps. And today I am three and a half years sober and living a life beyond my wildest dreams. A MIRACLE when I consider I relapsed over and over and over for YEARS, to the point I truly believed that I was a lost cause.

My biggest block with AA was that I thought it was a rigid, religious program. What I found out is that its actually a very flexible program, and doesn't have to be religious whatsoever. We even have an athiest meeting in town that is simply wonderful. 

I have noticed people have a LOT of blocks around AA (the term alcoholic, having a higher power,etc). I'm just curious what yours was and how did you work past it?

I notice my urges within 2 weeks, and it‚Äôs hard to stay sober. I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and lie and say it gets easier. It doesn‚Äôt, especially when everyone around is drinking  and it‚Äôs just the norm. I feel like an outsider again. When I was drinking again, I thought I could be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be a social drinker. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm a fucking alcoholic, and I have it in me to fuck up my life as much as possible and drink till I don‚Äôt remember how much I hate my fucking life. 

It‚Äôs not good, I‚Äôm not a social drinker and I have to keep reminding myself ‚Äúif you drink you won‚Äôt stop drinking, and when you don‚Äôt stop you do a lot of shit that hurts you and the people you care about.‚Äù I am not just doing this for my health, I‚Äôm doing it so I don‚Äôt keep killing myself or hurt anyone around me. 

When I‚Äôm drunk, everything that I suppress is unraveled and I confess the hate I have in my heart from all this pain I carry from all this pain I caused and manifested with my stupidity. I‚Äôm in my own carousel of self destructive behavior, because drinking was why the pain happened in the first place. I wanna end this cycle by just staying sober, but it‚Äôs hard because I don‚Äôt wanna face myself. I can‚Äôt stand myself today. I wanna punch myself for all the stupid mistakes.

Drinking is why I lost the love of my life. Drinking is why I got arrested and had wasted so much time with court and stupid shit. Drinking ruined future prospects of relationships I could have had, I could have been living with someone by now. Drinking is why I lost many friends, because I said things that I can‚Äôt take back. IVE LOST EVERYTHING.

I‚Äôm emotional today because I feel defeated by my past mistakes. I‚Äôm trying hard to focus on the future. I really am. I‚Äôm just pissed off today, sad, bothered and missing so many beautiful people that I can‚Äôt get a hold of. 

So what am I celebrating being sober? 
I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm just to upset with myself.. I‚Äôm writing and looking myself hard in the mirror trying to calm my urges because some days I want to say ‚ÄúFUCK IT‚Äù and just give up.. Other days I‚Äôm on a new high, because I know I‚Äôm in the right direction and I feel motivated to stay sober because I know I‚Äôm ok. 

Today was hard, but I will not drink because it‚Äôll just mean I have to start over.. I can‚Äôt give up because then it‚Äôll just mean I stayed sober just to go back to fucking up my life. . I‚Äôve made myself suffer so much because of drinking, and I wanna get off of this sad self-pitying carousel and be happy again.. I just want to be happy.

I cried while writing this, because I‚Äôm not happy today. But I‚Äôm sure tomorrow I‚Äôll be ok. If you made it here, thanks for stopping and reading. Thank you. 

30 days, congrats to me. Going for a year, and further. Wish me luck my fellow alcoholics

In the beginning, it was four whole years before A.A. brought permanent sobriety to even one alcoholic woman.  Like the 'high bottoms,' the women said they were different;... The Skid-Rower said he was different... so did the artists and the professional people, the rich, the poor, the religious, the agnostic, the Indians and the Eskimos, the veterans, and the prisoners... nowadays all of these, and legions more, soberly talk about how very much alike all of us alcoholics are when we admit that the chips are finally down.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 24

I cannot consider myself 'different' in A. A.; if I do I isolate myself from others and from contact with my Higher Power.  If I feel isolated in A.A., it is not something for which others are responsible.  It is something I've created by feeling I'm 'different' in some way.

Thursday, February 18, 2021 I came to the realization that I have a problem.

Today, Friday, February 19, 2021 I begin my new journey.

The purpose of this post is to finally admit to another person the life I have been living recently, as well as to give me something to reflect on to gauge my future progress. So, I‚Äôm not going to provide my full background and history, rather get right into my recent days.

&#x200B;

I began drinking when I was 16. I‚Äôm 28 now and my addiction has deteriorated to me drinking a minimum of 2 sleeves (20 nips) of whiskey a day. On my days off from work I‚Äôll sometimes drink 3 sleeves. This is every single day (except when the liquor store is closed on holidays and I forgot to stock up the night before‚Ä¶.or I stocked up and drank it all that night‚Ä¶) for the last two years.

Every morning, I wake up and spend time hunched over the toilet, vomiting blood and bile. My appetite has diminished to nothing. I am a big guy and even my friends and family comment how little I eat. Usually I skip breakfast and lunch, only to eat a tiny snack or half a sandwich at home late at night. When I do eat, I often throw up several minutes later. My face has bloated from the alcohol, and I am at my heaviest weight I have ever been. I have no motivation or energy to workout or even go for a walk. I used to take my dog out for hours-long hikes, but no more. I would rather stay home and drink. I am naturally a social person, but recently I‚Äôve declined social events and spending time with friends, rather to spend it with alcohol.

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs a shitty way to live.

Fuck, is it a shitty way to live.

&#x200B;

But, unless you live with me, it‚Äôs probably hard to tell I have a problem. I‚Äôve held down a full-time job--two jobs at the same time before the pandemic--and get compliments from my coworkers and patients‚Ä¶yes, patients.

I work at a substance abuse detox and treatment facility.

Every day I tell the folks who walk through our doors that they are doing the right thing, that they‚Äôve made a great decision, and that they‚Äôre in the right place.

Then, I go home and repeat the exact behavior of the people I am there to help. Turning a blind eye to my own behavior and ignoring my own advice.

&#x200B;

But yesterday, Thursday, February 18, 2021 something changed in the way I‚Äôm thinking.

I realize that I am lucky to be in the position I am today. I am fortunate that during this pandemic, I hold a decent job and work plenty of hours. Yet, I am continuously broke and frequently have to borrow money from family to meet my bills.I had to move back with family a while ago and have not been able to save and get a place on my own since.

Something is wrong.

&#x200B;

So, yesterday I added up all the charges on my bank statements for liquor stores.

In the month of January...31 days‚Ä¶I wasted $447.93 in alcohol. In December, I wasted $397.

My actual spending was slightly more than this because this is only based off of my bank statements. I keep no receipts when I use cash to buy my drinks.

This hit me like a ton of bricks and I know that I am finally ready to accept my alcoholism and reign it in. Clich√©, I know, but I now understand why you cannot force someone to change until they are truly ready.

What made me finally feel a difference in mindset is not the realization of how much money I waste on alcohol, but how much of my life I am wasting over alcohol. The residual effects on my family relationships, friendships, my health, and my future is worth much more than money.

Two days ago was my last drink. Yesterday, I had a severe headache. My appetite increased slightly and I ate more than I normally do when drinking. It‚Äôs early in the day, but today I feel decent. No puking this morning. I didn‚Äôt eat breakfast, but feel hunger coming on for lunch.

Only a day in, not much has probably changed physically, but I do feel something different.

I am doing this alone in the beginning. Taking a step from behind the anonymity of this forum and into public where I have to deal with this face-to-face with others is a step I am not yet ready for. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping in touch with a few others on here who are going through this as well.

&#x200B;

I DO NOT want to promise myself that I will never drink again, because I know relapses are real and temptations will creep up.

I DO promise myself never to revert to drinking at the pace I am now.

I am unhappy and displeased with my current life and only I can change it.

I just came to that realization at 28 years of age and am beginning my new life on February 19, 2021--a very important day for me.

It REALLY rubbed me the wrong way because she was clearly joking, but alcoholism is a disease that effects so many people very seriously and is a serious struggle to come back from.

At once, I became a part - if only a tiny part - of a cosmos...

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 225

When I first came to A.A., I decided that 'they' were very nice people - perhaps a little naive, a little too friendly, but basically decent, earnest people (with whom I had nothing in common).  I saw 'them' at meetings - after all, that was where 'they' existed.  I shook hands with 'them' and, when I went out the door, I forgot about 'them.'  Then one day my Higher Power, whom I did not then believe in, arranged to create a community project outside of A.A., but one which happened to involve many A.A. members.  We worked together, I got to know 'them' as people.  I came to admire 'them,' even to like 'them' and, in spite of myself, to enjoy 'them.'  'Their' practice of the program in their daily lives - not just in talk at meetings - attracted me and I wanted what they had.  Suddenly the 'they' became 'we.'  I have not had a drink since.

Such is the paradox of A.A. regeneration: strength arising out of complete defeat and weakness, the loss of one's old life as a condition for finding a new one.

- A.A. COMES OF AGE, p. 46

What glorious mysteries paradoxes are!  They do not compute, yet when recognized and accepted, they reaffirm something in the universe beyond human logic.  When I face a fear, I am given courage; when I support a brother or sister, my capacity to love myself is increased; when I accept pain as part of the growing experience of life, I realize a greater happiness; when I look at my dark side, I am brought into new light; when I accept my vulnerabilities and surrender to a Higher Power, I am graced with unforeseen strength.  I stumbled through the doors of A.A. in disgrace, expecting nothing from life, and I have been given hope and dignity.  Miraculously, the only way to keep the gifts of the program is to pass them on.

I'm 29 and spent the last 7 years post-college partying it up in Manhattan.

I had two now ex-girlfriends watch me gradually transform from honeymoon-phase, sweet guy into alcoholic monster guy, sometimes right before their eyes in a single night. I partied like the Wolf of Wall Street because alcohol + cocaine made it fun and NYC has a lot of opportunities for an addict like myself.

I truly thought i would drink and use until I died or it killed me. I couldn't stop drinking without going back into a rehab and I could not stay stopped. 

February 29th of last year, I surrendered. I gave up trying to figure out the bare minimum I could do to stay sober. I gave up fighting my addiction. I gave up on the idea that I could hate myself and/or my addiction enough to stay sober. I let go. 

What has happened in this last year is nothing short of a miracle. In the face of indescribable suffering I found the willingness to get radically honest with myself. To accept myself. To love myself. 

The great joy of my entire life has not been the warm love and support of family and friends when I was utterly broken, but rather it has been the opportunity to be there in return for those people I care so deeply about. 

As the pages turn and one chapter gives way to the next, I understand today more than ever that, ""obstacles aren't in the path, obstacles are the path.""

To anyone suffering today, recovery is possible. There is hope. You are loved and you are worthy of compassion. Although we may walk separate paths, may our companionship lighten the load and light the way.

My truck broke down on Feb 8th so I couldn't go to the store for a few days, waiting for parts to arrive. I finished my last bottle the evening of Feb 8th. Since I couldn't buy more, I didn't drink on the 9th. It wasn't horrible so I decided to try ANOTHER day. I haven't touched a drop since!
My stepdaughter moved out and I was cleaning out her room 4 days ago and found 3 bottle of hers. Normally, they would be long gone by now, but they are still in the cupboard, waiting for her to come get her stuff! I'm pretty proud of myself! 
I feel so stupid! I was so afraid to quit. If I'd have known how much better I would feel and how quitting wouldn't be this horribly miserable experience like I thought it would, I'd have quit YEARS ago!
I've lost about 7lbs and I feel like a normal human again. My boyfriend of 10 years and I are getting along and I'm really enjoying hanging out and doing things with my teen daughters. I'm keeping busy painting my kitchen and dining room and getting ready to strip and refinish the cabinets with my middle daughter today!  
I'm a musician and I've started playing for PLEASURE again, not just a paycheck! I feel like a completely different person.
I don't have anyone in real life to share with, so I joined this sub! I wish everyone the best of luck with their sobriety. It really is life changing!",12,0

As the pandemic was getting bad, my depression was getting worse. I wasn't taking my medication because, for the most part, I was handling it. When Covid hit, I was so mentally unstable that I need to start it up again. I talked to my doctor and got a new medication that I couldn't drink on. So, I stopped drinking for two months. When I was off the booze, I noticed things about me that changed. I didn't wake up sick every day. My skin looked amazing! I dropped 5 lbs. I could drive to places at night. I could do that 45 minute night time beauty routine that I plan but never do. I never drunkily order fast food. It was great, sort of. Towards the end of the two months, I went on vacation (I know. During the pandemic.) We went any ways. For a fancy dinner we had, my husband ordered at $15 drink and $32 steak. The side were Al a Carte. The restaurant didn't have any vegetarian options so I ordered neither a drink nor an entree. I felt pathetic. I determined that I must get off my medication as soon as we got home and that is what I did. 
Now, everything is different. When I drink, I feel the need to get blackout drunk everytime. When I stop, every Sunday night, I get massively depressed and turn back to drinking. Since starting drinking again, I went to one AA meeting. I couldn't call myself an alcoholic so I never returned. I thought I could do a moderation things. My grandma was in Overeaters Anonymous and they had to practice moderation because they can't just quit eating. After trying to drink moderately, I fail most times.

When I first wanted to get sober, things had gotten bad enough that I convinced myself to go to an AA meeting.    I sat in the back by the door next to the people there on court orders.  I don't know what makes it finally click for people, but I know it starts with desperation and a realization, this ain't the life I wanted.   What I didn't realize the only person in that room that I can't trust is ME!  I seem to be the source of most of my problems - you know that voice in our heads that says, ""hey, you're not this bad!"" and ""yeah, I'm not doing this"" and ""it's not for me""  

I saw a sign on the way to work today for a spiritual center that read Obtain Truly Effortless Living Here.  I thought what the heck is effortless living anyway?   And having been sober for 3 years, I remembered that's what I thought getting sober would be.  I'll go to a few meetings, and get a book and wallah problem solved.  Well nothing in my life, that was worth doing ever was done by quick fix.  It took me finally being willing to say, ""Hey, can I get a sponsor?"" and ""Do you have books here?"" and ""What's a good meeting around here?""  Got out of my head and out of my own way.  

Looking back, being sober is amazing.  I have a peaceful state of mind without anxiety that no drug or alcohol ever brought me.  For each of us, it's our own road to haul and I wish the best to anyone just coming in, you can do this.  I agreed to go for 1 year, which was good because after 3 months, my family started asking if I was all better yet.

1. Mornings are amazing, I feel great and ready for the day. 

2. My anxiety is still there. But I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs reduced by at least half. Alcohol for some people like me is like gasoline to anxiety.

3. I can go out and have fun and experience life sober. I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs even more fun to be present and remember the experience the next day.

4. My relationships have improved and will continue to do so.

5. I was spiritually dead for many years. The higher power thing was tough, but the love and peace I‚Äôve found by being open to spirituality is powerful. I‚Äôm amazed at what and open mind and heart can do for your mindset and outlook on life. 

6. Humility is good and I need to continue to practice it.

7. Meetings are amazing, the wisdom in those rooms is beyond words.

8. Sex is way better.

9. Emotions like fear and anger are still there, but my ability to handle them in a balanced way is night and day compared to my drinking days.

10. At 43, I now know that I deserve to be happy and loved. Forgiving yourself is a big step.

Today is my anniversary date and I just wanted to share how much this reddit page has helped me over the past year. I got on reddit about 3 months into the pandemic, because I found out that other forms of social media are blasted by negativity and fear mongering. I found this group as soon as I got on reddit and have taken advantage of the frequently posted daily reflections, and opportunities for service. 

This year has been the hardest year in my recovery so far. I went into a dark place around 3 months into the pandemic and lost faith in my higher power. I began to live in fear everyday regarding the end of the world. I began to go to therapy, and was trying to find a way to quit feeling the way I felt. 

The simple part was all I needed to do was go back through the steps with my sponsor. I had picked up a new sponsor and sort of a cure all and it did not go well at all. Him and I did not work well together, and at the end of it now I have someone new on my inventory lol. I picked up my old sponsor and I kept it as simple as I could. I am not saying that therapy did not help, and I am extremely glad that I started going to therapy and am still going to therapy. I had quit using the steps in my everyday life, and going back and doing them again has helped me so much.

I fucking love you all so much. My home group is finally meeting in person again, and I have the privilege of chairing our month back. Last year I did not get to pick up my four year chip, because I was afraid that I would kill one of the older members in my group. I am just so grateful.

At the beginning of this year, I experienced a break up that shook me to my core. It broke me down, flattened me, until I was begging on my knees to be able to feel life, light, love, hope‚Äîanything, again. This time, it was love towards myself that I was missing. I have other problems besides alcohol. I have learned to accept the mistakes I made as an alcoholic. I have never learned how to accept my other problems. After this break up, my mind felt like a hurricane made of ice, surrounded by frozen daggers stabbing my deepest wounds and darkest weaknesses.

I was desperate, hopeless, and alone during the coldest winter I have ever felt. I wasn‚Äôt actually alone on the outside; my friends and family kept trying to lift me up, pull me out of this black hole I had enveloped myself in, and help me see the light again. Without them and my pets, I‚Äôm not sure if I would have made it through. They did not let me quit. Their love saved me on a daily basis, but I still wasn‚Äôt able to believe that I would be able to save myself.

Faith and God are both something that are so important to my sobriety. My higher power gives me peace and the will to keep going. At the beginning of this year, I was unable to connect to God‚Äôs presence. It‚Äôs like there was a barrier; a towering, endless brick wall between me and my higher power that no matter how hard I tried, I was unable to crack into or peer over the top. This was depression. The deepest I had felt since before getting sober, and I was so scared. I was terrified that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to yank myself out of these terrible, ruminating thoughts of hopelessness. I was crying all the time; sobbing wails of what the fuck is happening to me and the world. 

I hadn‚Äôt been to an AA meeting in at least two years. I was just trying to do it on my own. About 14 days ago, I made the decision to log onto a Zoom meeting. I found this link in the comments section for a post on the /stopdrinking Subreddit page. https://aa-intergroup.org/oiaa/meetings/ To whomever posted this link, I thank you so much. 

For the past 14 days, I have been going to the same meeting every night. Between 400-500 people attend it. The very first night I went was the night I was able to feel God‚Äôs presence again. The magic that lies within the walls of AA and this incredible community, even through recovering people on tiny square screens, is something I cannot tangibly describe. It all works the same. The words and people of AA create a shining presence through God that can be seen and felt. So whatever that means and for whatever it‚Äôs worth, it‚Äôs a lot. And with that, I will keep coming back and taking life one day at a time.",16,0

My hope is that in sharing it, someone can draw from my life experience and if this helps only one person, then the years have been worth it.

By March 12, 2013 I was freshly 22 years old. I had been kicked out of one of the best colleges in the world and stepped down to a lesser one, I had to return home hat in hand. My liver was failing, my health deteriorating from drinking over a fifth of hard liquor a day.

I had reached the point where in the last weeks of drinking, my tolerance for alcohol had plummeted to a few shots only. Those who are familiar with the Jelinek Curve can see that it is a stage you really do not want to be in.

By then I had already tried unsuccessfully to quit drinking for a few months, but nothing worked.

My breaking point, or should I say, the point where I realized enough was enough‚Ä¶. I was sitting in class around 530 pm and I pulled out my phone and googled AA meetings. Right then and there. Saw there was a meeting at 630 a few miles away.

In a break in the class, I went up to the professor and said: ‚ÄúSir, something came up, can I take leave early?‚Äù I remember it crystal clear he responded jokingly: ‚ÄúIs it a matter a life and death?‚Äù I stayed quiet for about 5 seconds and looked back at him somberly and said: ‚ÄúYes Sir, it is.‚Äù He gave me leave.

I left school and headed to that meeting. Been sober ever since.

I have graduated college, started a business, started a family, lived through the death of my mother, changed residences and states, changed workplaces, lived through deaths of friends and people I love, gained friends and lost friends. All of the above, sober and without a single drink. It IS possible, just go for it as if your life depends on it and as if it were a matter of life and death, because as I said eight years ago‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYes sir, it is.‚Äù",114,0

Thankful for my family, friends, and sober community. No more cravings, those went away a while ago. But my emotions are way too much most days. I‚Äôm trying to do it right, and recovery is a full- time job. I have no idea how people do everything and do recovery/ the steps full- time, too with family, work, school, and everything. And how people don‚Äôt feel emotionally horrible all of the time and drained. Trying so hard, man.

Edit because folks are suggesting 12- step: I‚Äôm in the program, I have a sponsor, I‚Äôm working the steps, I go to meetings everyday, I call/ text sober people all day, everyday.

Prior sobriety attempts, I did not, and I think this was my failure, I did not maintain after going to IOP‚Äôs. I just thought I was ‚Äúfine‚Äù now. I was an awful dry drunk, and/ or relapsed within six months every time. I also didn‚Äôt work the steps in the IOP‚Äôs that I went to, they weren‚Äôt a part of any of them.

Before the program I went out of my way to act out and use. 
I. Am. Changing.

Walked out of my apartment in socks and sandals, vest and long sleeve T.
Certain that 35 ish degrees would shift to almost 55 ish degrees. 
It must‚Äôve slipped my mind that this is The Windy City.

By 1pm a hustle toward the North Ave bus proved to be futile. 
Neck twisting. Finger numbing cold air. Slow-walk through windy resistance. 

Mind chatter:
‚ÄúBut, you have other stuff to do.‚Äù

Plans change. It is too cold.
The bus home conveniently awaits. My chariot to Easy Street.

Mind chatter races.
‚ÄúOh, you have to make a program call anyway.‚Äù

What could‚Äôve been a direct route to the Alano Club was a protracted alternate route through the apartment on Chestnut for boots and thigh length wool coat. Maybe.

More chatter.
‚ÄúWell, you can go next week.‚Äù

Ready to give up. Transit tracked. 10 minutes. Easy does it. Breathe.
The trek continues. 

Now for the transfer. Transit tracked. 15 minutes. 
Alternate bus #1. 12 minutes.
Alternate bus #2 13 minutes. 

Chatter quickens. 
‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt make it on time.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, at least your intentions were there.‚Äù 

Pivot. Time to make the program call for a 10th step. Spirit, lifted.
Auto-pilot kicks in. Original plan back on. In-person meeting.
HP is all around. All it takes is a little honesty, little hope, little faith, little courage.

Arrival. The front door. A gateway to face Self. 
Gifted the window of others' story. Gifted a mirror to Self. 

Three people in attendance.
What could‚Äôve felt sad‚Ä¶
Turned into an hour and a half meeting.

Was small but powerful.

It works if you work it. Always. 

Peace and Love, friends.

I remember the times I looked up into the sky and reflected on who started it all, and how.  When I came to A.A., an understanding of some description of the spiritual dimension became a necessary adjunct to a stable sobriety.  After reading a variety of versions, including the scientific, of a great explosion, I went for simplicity and made the God of my understanding the Great Power that made the explosion possible.  With the vastness of the universe under His command, He would, no doubt, be able to guide my thinking and actions if I was prepared to accept His guidance.  But I could not expect help if I turned my back on that help and went my own way.  I became willing to believe and I have had 26 years of stable and satisfying sobriety.

If you are addicted to alcohol I'm begging you please find help to quit and once you quit keep on fighting. Get the poison out of your life. My mom lost her mom (my grandma) in a car wreck when she was 17. She was driving drunk and fell asleep. That caused my mom to have depression and anxiety. She got married had me and my two younger sisters and she was good. Her and my dad used to fight alot so they got divorced when I was about 10. Now I've learned later on that she has always drank and it was bad but she was good at hiding it. As I grew older she couldn't fool me. It was so bad, she lost friends she lost her happiness. My mom had no one but me and my sisters. When we were at my father's house she would drink like hell. When we came over it wasn't as bad but she did it. It made her unhappy and agressive and short tempered. My sisters didn't know anything but I knew it all she would go through a shit ton of beer every week. I always talked to her, I talked to people to send her away to a rehab place but they said there was no financial to pay for it and she was broke but my dads rich. He wouldn't pay for it, not his problem. It began to get bad. She went to the hospital and went through detox and was there for about a month. She came back and it was amazing but behind my back she started up again. Later on she developed Psoriasis on her liver. ( Sorry if I spelled it wrong ) later on she kept going and id cry to her to try and get her to realize what's happening what she's doing to her family but she didn't stop. She hit the late stage in psoriasis and got a liver transplant. I surely thought she was done there's no fucking way she will start drinking.... I was fucking wrong and I found out and I flipped the fuck out on her I cried to her "" mom what the fuck are you doing to us. You have three kids that love you more then anyone in the world you are our idol we look up to you. You won't even see me fucking graduate"" she was drunk and said I have these pills I'll be fine ( pills so her body dosent reject the new liver ) I freaked out. About a year of be begging and crying to her goes by I'm at my dad's and we were supposed to go see her and we don't and I ask my dad and he sits me down and says Gage. Your mother is in the hospital she was supposed to go down and get a little procedure and come home to you but shes not gonna make it... I've never ever in my life felt so much pain. It felt like a fucking bomb went off inside my body. We went down to see her and she was gone she was so drugged up to not feel medicine she couldn't talk she didn't know anything she was high as fuck on painkillers. Barely alive because she got an infection in her heart and the liver was failing. This is my story my mom is gone I lost her 01/02/21 me and my mom shared a birthday February 8th I was turning 16 and now nothing will ever be he same. please if you actually read my story I hope you know what it does to a person to lose family to alcohol and it pushes you to stop please do everything you can because I will forever be missing my mommyüíî",91,0

I didn't go through an actually break up but I like to use this poem to remember all the things I can do without alcohol. I can drive at night. I can get a full nights rest without waking up hungover and hating my life.

I started attending AA meetings 3 weeks ago. first 5 days of meetings = 5 days of sobriety. Instantly, I see how healing these rooms and connecting with other alcoholics is. I relapsed; 3 day bender; then when back to the meetings. Then a 13 day stretch of sobriety. The program fucking works. And today; I fuck it up. So to the point of my post:  


If anyone reading this is in Calgary, do you have any tips for me to find a sponsor? Specifically: What are good meetings around town to find a sponsor?  PREFERABLY in the Northern quadrants \*crossing fingers\*....I need more accountability. I'm just NOT as smart as my alcoholic self THOUGHT I was and I really need someone to help me through the steps. I can't/won't proceed into step 4 without some help. I'm blessed that the concept of a higher power comes easy to me, so that's something.....

Any general tips from ANYONE on the sub for finding a sponsor would be appreciated! 

So, I'm new to Calgary. Small town guy. I'm blessed that the meetings I've been attending are so close to my house - navigating the highways into different quadrants is a bit intimidating atm. I won't disclose which meetings in Calgary I'm attending, but will be happy to disclose via DM if someone from the area reads this. I'll just say that I really love the meetings, I'm a rough/tumble small town dude and these meetings are raw/real, and i'm starting to really like some of these lovely people. I've heard the \_\_\_\_\_ block meetings i've been attending aren't for everyone but they are for me. I came in early this morning and asked ""So how do I find a sponsor?"" And he basically told me  ""In Meetings around the city, they'll ask for a show of hands of who is looking for sponsees"" Yet for some reason, this isn't practiced in the block I've been attending. But I love this group. Anyway I figured I'd make this post. I'll keep inquiring with IRL people. Buddy also told me ""Just ask some of the old timers at our block, they might be looking"". I gotta man up and not be so 'shy' lol. I wish I could say I'll take another 24 now, but that ship has sailed. God speed people.",11,0

What I want to explain to everyone here is how it effects everyone around you. What we go through as a result of the alcoholism to maybe help you find a way to cope and get better. 

I struggled alongside her daily, emotionally. I wanted to do everything and thing that I could to make her better and I wanted so badly to just ""fix"" her. Near the end it got to the point where I couldn't sleep well anymore because I worried so much and I couldn't stop thinking about ways to try help her. I ended up having a mental breakdown and had to go to the hospital myself due to stress related issues from this situation. 

I don't blame her for any of it though. She couldn't help it and she couldn't stop even after professional help and treatment. It's something that took over her life and kept her stuck in the past instead of seeing the beautiful things that she had right in front of her. The bottle kept her stuck in that terrible place and she just couldn't escape.

I love my mom with my entire heart and I want nothing more than to have her with me again. I am sure that all of your families feel the same way as I have felt throughout this long battle. It's not just a war that you have with yourself and the bottle, but a war that your family is stuck in as well. Regardless if they have cut you off or push you away, they still care and always will. Family never stops caring and the emotional toll on us is far greater than you think it is. Please fight and find ways to get better. Please do everything that you can to put it down for good. You have more strength than you know. 

What you can do to help yourself and you family is to be honest. My mom would try to hide her drinking and we never really new how bad it had become until it was too late. Open up to your family and be honest. Don't lie when they ask you how bad it is because doing so will help them and help you. It is embarrassing and it is hard, I know. But it's even harder having to bury a loved one, trust me. 

Please find help any and every way that you can. Your family will be there even if they are mad at you. They still love you. If they didn't care or love you then they wouldn't show any emotion to you. 

You are strong. Fight for yourself and for your family. Don't let your story end like my mom's did.",54,0
1777,Will AA accept me if I have a drug problem?,18,mfsdx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/mfsdx4/will_aa_accept_me_if_i_have_a_drug_problem/,66,1617032684.0,"Greetings friends

My name is Chris and so wanted your opinion on addicts in AA. I am attracted to AA because it seems more effective and successful in my eyes. Members have long term sobriety and the largest fellowship of recovery in the world.

I abused alcohol heavily from 16-22. Recently I have used alcohol in excess to full my emotions and escape seeking oblivion. 

My biggest problem is opiates (I realize this was never the intention for AA and I respect the traditions of AA).

I want to get sober from all substances including alcohol but I consume opiates far more than alcohol. 

So my question is, is there a place for me in AA? How would I share about my using - simply say alcohol to keep the focus on the primary purpose while knowing that for me, alcohol means ALL substances?

I worry that because my experience with alcohol isn‚Äôt as recent or heavy as my experience with drugs and I don‚Äôt want to offend or dilute the message of AA.

TLDR; I‚Äôm primarily an opiate user. Can I be successful in AA by any measure?

Thanks and love to all

Eager to get sober

1778,I stole.,23,mfz3eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/mfz3eo/i_stole/,11,1617050733.0,"Today I stole a k-cup coffee pod from my roommate. Went back and forth about it a few times and ultimately I justified stealing it with thoughts like, ""it's just a k-cup, he has like 30 of them, if I don't steal it from the top of the stack he won't even notice, he has always let me have one before so he probably won't mind."" 

He noticed almost immediately and told me very calmly and directly that he doesn't want me to take them without asking, it wasn't a big deal, please don't do it again. God I am grateful to have an emotionally mature roommate to set such a beautiful example of assertive communication for me.

Anyways, despite his graceful response, I felt a pretty intense wave of shame come over me. Sure I stole a bunch while in active addiction, but that was just the alcohol causing me to act out of my right mind, wasn't it? No. I have glaring character defects, many of which I am very ashamed of. I lie and steal while drunk and while sober, though definitely less heinously and less frequently since getting sober.

I called my sponsor on the way to pick up a new box of k-cups. I basically felt forced to make amends and call immediately bc of how shitty I felt. My sponsored offered these words of wisdom (paraphrasing):

""When you make an amends, it's important to also extend forgiveness to yourself for making a mistake, something that humans do. Don't forget that God forgives you, and therefore it is OK to forgive yourself for this mistake.""

He also told me to read the 10th step in the big book and 12/12, and to continue to investigate this defect of character inventory style. Usually my defects go back to some sort of fear, it's pretty obvious to me now that this one is fear based. Time to do the work, pray, thank God for the incredible progress he's helped me make in handling this sort of situation maturely, and grow. I still feel some shame but it's not crushing me and I know I'm headed in the direction of self-love if I keep working at it. Thanks for reading my story :)",23,0

What helped me a lot in early recovery was having a lot of different drinks to choose from. Non-alcoholic, of course. But, I got several flavors of Crystal Lite, Dr Pepper, Seltzer, Root Beer, Pineapple Juice and so forth. It's comforting for us, the process of just grabbing your drink. But with this, you can have that drink, and that urge along with it, but enjoy multiple different kinds of drinks that can satisfy that craving. I remember even double fisting two types of crystal lite in my first week of getting sober.

I will try and keep this as anonymous as I can while also providing details enough to explain what is happening here. I am horrible with TL;DR because I feel like details help clarify everything better.

First off, this is not applied to me, this is for a friend who I volunteered to break the news to. I respect this person a lot. They have over 40 years of sobriety and that doesn't come from nowhere. This takes place in USA and at a clubhouse (not sure if this matters or if AA is the same worldwide). There was a business meeting recently and they had decided to vote said friend out of the one weekly meeting (there are several meetings here through the day / week). I'm unsettled because there was not the group conscience of saying through each meeting until the next business one that there would be a vote to decide if this person could be banned from the one weekly meeting.

So why did these 6 or so people want to ban him? They feel he is too negative. They don't think he has a message that is helpful. They claim that newcomers won't share in fear of cross talk and that many don't come back because of this person. I can speak from my personal experience and interactions only which is that for the first year or so that I came to this clubhouse (I have over a decade sober myself) he was a prick and I didn't like him but I was also able to ignore his bullcrap to focus on the message elsewhere. Overtime I just decided to tell him to shut the eff up and since then (a year now) he has been a totally different person towards me. I have grown to respect him and hear within his shares that he does have a positive message. This small group have claimed that, along with the cross talk, he let's his phone ring, curses, (both are said in the format to refrain from... more on that later...), and is general disruptive with whispering and such.

From what I have witnessed: A LOT of people curse and their phones ring and many other people also cross talk and whisper to one another. I mentioned in the business meeting that maybe it be the responsibility of the chair to speak to whomever is being disruptive and mention the format again. They turned that down. These people are hell bent on focusing on this ""bully"" (which to me is hypocritical since they are being equally unfair).  All this to say the person didn't get to come to the business meeting (my fault honestly because he mentioned he was going out of state and I figured he wouldn't want to cancel that to come to the meeting). Either way, they didn't announce for group conscience anyway, like I said.

I plan on calling GSO and I have done some googling but I can't find a really solid answer on this. This is a person who is also on the clubhouse board and runs their own beginners meeting so I'm a bit confused why there is such a strong determined small group of individuals who have taken it upon themselves to vote and ban this person.

What is the difference in being a group member and a home group? How does one get a home group?

I keep hearing people say for new people, ""take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth"". Because of this I've been very reluctant to share in the meetings. Is that what that means? Should I keep quiet in the meetings until I have some decent time built up?

I know a sponsor is there to help you but how frequent is the contact? Like do I need to talk to them everyday? Do I need to call and check in? Or do I just call when I have a craving?

I keep hearing about service work but I am not completely sure what exactly that is? I try to get to meetings early to help out but when I get there everything is already set up and ready to go. Is there something else I should be doing? I have been getting to all my meetings 30min early already. Or is service work like volunteer work with the community?

What if I have genuinely been doing pretty good on my own? My cravings are usually pretty short and I haven't been going nuts. I am still working on turning my will over to my higher power as well. Am I doing something wrong? Do the cravings get worse as time goes on? I drank heavily for 20 years and struggled mightily prior to going to rehab to quit so I know the cravings are there.

I couldn't touch a drink without binge drinking. It could never just be a glass or 2 of wine. Once the booze was in my system it was on. It was Ready. Set. Get Hammered! This was 3-4 times a week. I was either drunk or hungover. This was for 20 years. 

Quit on NYE 2020. This is the longest i've gone without it in 20 years. 37 now. Tried many many times but never lasted more than 30 days. 

I thought my life would miraculously change for the better. But I have to say that hasn't been the case. It's like i've been wearing tinted glasses (denial) for 20 years and now they're truly off and all I see around me is dirt. Everything is grim. Not just what I can see, but how I feel about things. Past toxic friendships, abusive relationships.... how on earth did I let people treat me like that? How did I treat myself like that? For the first time i'm seeing things how they really are. I live in a grotty flatshare which I can no longer bear. I've had dead end awful jobs with awful colleagues. Grim. I want more for myself.I always have deep down but just didn't have any motivation to improve my life situation. Alcohol was the wool over my eyes and the escapism and denial of my grim life situation.

The journey since I quit has been TOUGH. I've taken some extreme measures. The most being cutting myself off from everyone I consider toxic. Which has left me with pretty much nobody. Even my family members, who i've always had a strained relationship with. I'm seeing things clearly now. I'm seeing things for how they really are. No ""Yeah but x, yeah but y"" excuses. The writing's on the wall. And I can't escape anymore by drinking. So I have to feel it all. And it feels shit. 20 years of hella bad decisions has got me to this life situation where i'm alone in the world with nothing and no-one. And i'm having to start my life afresh at 37. Impossible? No. Hard as fuck? Yes. 

Its (sobriety) forced me to think a lot about what I want the rest of my days to look like. Work wise I've always liked the idea of doing something that helps people. Just before I quit I signed up to do an open university course in Computer Science as I like the idea of doing a tech job remotely as I see myself travelling in the future. But I think I also want to go down the Wellness route. I've always been fascinated by alternative healing, and eastern therapies like yoga. I'm planning on going for my yoga teacher training and also training in reflexology. I love the idea of being a healer as one thing Ive discovered is that the majority, if not all, of us are holding on to some kind of pain. Its there. Trapped and causing a whole heap of emotional and spiritual problems. I feel like im healing myself through this process. I regularly burst out crying during yoga and meditation. 

So although my life resembles a shit show right now, I know its going to get better. I'm studying my ass off with this uni course. 20 years out of education doesnt help! But its taught me that nothing worth having comes easy. I read David Goggins' ""Can't Hurt Me"" which has probably helped me more than I realise. Im obsessed with him now and regularly listen to podcasts where he's being interviewed. I recomend it to anybody who is struggling with motivation. One of my favourite quotes of his is ""To find peace, you have to go to war"". And boy do I feel like i'm in battle right now. There are still some addictions i'm trying to crack (sugar and TV!) but I did quit smoking the day I quit drinking.

I have to up my yoga and fitness game and I have to find another job  (been made redundant from current one but it was a toxic environment to for the better) but I have a strong feeling that the only way is up.

What's really surprising is that I have had zero desire to go anywhere near alcohol, mostly this past month. I havent had to use any willpower. Whenever I even think about booze now I feel sick and disgusted. I might have a fleeting thought when im going through some kind of stress and/or low mood like ""Maybe a drink would take the edge of"" But then I quickly realise that just one drink is my rusty ticket right back to the hell i've clawed myself out of.

For anyone wanting to quit, my advice would be to expect and be prepared for tough times. Your emotions are going to hit you like a tonne of bricks. But after rain comes shine.",21,0
1805,[Update] trying to quit drinking but can‚Äôt handle the shakes,25,mkjh1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/mkjh1j/update_trying_to_quit_drinking_but_cant_handle/,28,1617625559.0,"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/mj527x/trying_to_quit_drinking_but_cant_handle_the/)

(TLDR at the bottom) I don‚Äôt know if this is allowed, if not I‚Äôll edit an update into the original. I just had so many people offering advice I wanted to be sure they had a chance to see this. First off thank you for replying to me, I promise I‚Äôm taking you all seriously. I spent the weekend trying to come up with a way to handle medical detox, trying to look up information on doing it outpatient near me, stuff like that. While I did that I still kept trying to wean off of the alcohol. Well Saturday night I went all night long without a drink for the first time in a long time. It wasn‚Äôt easy, I kept waking up with tremors and having to keep myself from going and grabbing the bottle but I did it. I did drink a small amount twice yesterday but pushed it 8 hours between. Last night I actually slept all night. I got up once (damn bladder) and for the first time in as long as I can remember I got up and came back to bed without having to fight with myself not to drink. Still had very very strange dreams where I felt like I was waking up just to be in another dream, very disorienting. I woke up this morning exhausted but NO SHAKES. And the bottle I bought Saturday morning is still over half full whereas normally a (big) bottle lasts me less than a day. I am still being cautious, thanks to you guys I did more research and saw where sometimes it can be days before the bad symptoms set in so I‚Äôm still looking into programs around me. And I‚Äôm also looking into online support meetings because even though I want desperately to stop entirely I can tell it‚Äôs going to be an ongoing issue. 

When I had said that I‚Äôd lose everything and everyone it wasn‚Äôt an idle thought. My brother went into the army and when he did he took up drinking. The army ultimately had to put him into rehab for it and when my family found out that was it. He was completely cut off from everyone and my family actively campaigned to have his daughter completely cut off from him (ultimately his ex allowed a custody arrangement). He is still dead to the family years later and he was always the golden child. I am a widow who relies on my family heavily to help since I‚Äôm raising an 8 year old on my own now. I live next door to my mother in a small house my family bought for us when my husband died. If they found out I would be out on the street and my son would be with my mother. So I‚Äôm serious when I say that going to even a 72 hour detox somewhere is not a possibility. 

TLDR: weaning off while researching detox is working-slept all night without drinking and woke up not shaking",25,0

1. PAWS - Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome
If you are are not familiar, learn about it. We put our bodies thru hell for an extended period. It is not typically going to recover from this in a short period of time. The effects of 10 years of drinking isn't going away in a few months. Be kind to yourself.


2. We *trained* our people to treat us the way they do. But sometimes when we get a little sobriety under our belt, we start to get annoyed with them for the ways they react to us. They are not in our head, they don't know how we really feel. That is time is different. So when they question actions that in the past meant we were or might be drinking, remember that WE trained them to think that way. Be kind to them.


3. As we get further into sobriety, we can sometimes feel that the time we have is a shield. But sobriety is walking along the beach. No matter how far we have gotten, the water is still right there. It ebbs and flows and if we are not paying attention, it can sneak up and get us again.

Stay sober my friends. And if you slip, start AGAIN. You can do this.

My Dad always sensed a drinking problem was afoot.  At 11 months sober in AA, working a solid program, I told him the truth.  At a lunch, I showed him my Big Book.  He asked, ""You like that kind of thing?...""  I just said, ""Yeah, I do"".   He's pretty old.

He launched into a scientific explanation of why I might have an addiction.

Something like, ""You know, it's genetic - you got it from your mom!  Her Dad was a drunk too!""  And then onto, ""It's the number x chromosome, it's scientifically possible to do a test to see who will be predisposed to alcoholism""  My first thought was, ""why is he so focused on the WHY?""  His words trailed off as I thought how little difference the WHY makes.  It doesn't matter whether I did it to myself, I inherited it, or I caught it like a cold.  What matters is the solution.  And no matter what the cause the solution is the same.

As my HP was passing those thoughts through my mind, I replied with exactly that.  ""Dad, none of that matters.  It doesn't matter why.  What matters is this program works and it's been about a year now.  It's much better.""  He seemed happy with that, he looked up and smiled.  I said, 'Hey let me read you something from my Big Book.""  He suffered through it I guess, looked up and said, ""I don't get it"".

I said, ""Hey - sorry for the trouble I caused over the years related to my drinking, thanks for being there"" and we left it at that.

That was two years ago, he's nearly at the end of his life now, but he still asks, ""Are you doing that program?""  and I say, ""Yeah Dad, I'm doing that program"". To which he say's, ""You like that kind of thing?""",74,0

Resentment is the 'number one' offender.  It destroys more alcoholics than anything else.  From it stem all forms of spiritual disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually sick.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 64

As I look at myself practicing the Fourth Step, it is easy to gloss over the wrong that I have done, because I can easily see it as a question of 'getting even' for a wrong done to me.  If I continue to relive my old hurt, it is a resentment and resentment bars the sunlight from my soul.  If I continue to relive hurts and hates, I will hurt and hate myself.  After years in the dark of resentments, I have found the sunlight.  I must let go of resentments; I cannot afford them.

Well this time... I got the pink cloud at first.  Then it went away.  Then I got scared.  I couldn‚Äôt deny that my life had stopped getting worse, but I didn‚Äôt feel any better, and it didn‚Äôt seem like anything was changing.  So I kept coming.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself at first.  I needed a to do list just to get myself to shower.  I was anxious all the time.  So I just went to meetings.  Some days I cried through them, some days I couldn‚Äôt really focus, some days I sat there judging every single person that spoke.  But I had nothing else to do, I didn‚Äôt want to drink, and I couldn‚Äôt be alone.  So I kept coming.

Then I started to see the miracles in things I didn‚Äôt expect.  Miracles don‚Äôt scream at you, they whisper.  I‚Äôd find myself sitting alone with my thoughts without even realizing it, something that had scared me more than anything in the past.  My skin was clearing up and I was flossing my teeth.  I remembered how I liked to cook.  I was sleeping again.  I got a sponsor and started working the steps.  I didn‚Äôt feel like it was working.  I was an emotional wreck.  People said I seemed better, even though I felt worse.  So I kept coming.

At almost 30 days, I drank.  I felt ashamed.  I wanted to die.  I didn‚Äôt want the relapse to keep going.  So I kept coming.

It was a miracle I made it back.  A big one.  Those miracles were getting louder now.  Even I couldn‚Äôt ignore them anymore.  My partner and I got back together.  I was getting offered jobs (I freelance) and was called a hard worker.  My parents and I were having nice conversations, well, most of the time.  I still felt like shit a lot.  I was sometimes overwhelmed with anxiety over things I‚Äôd done, or things I imagined might‚Äôve happened that I just couldn‚Äôt remember.  So I kept coming.

My home group started to have a lot of drama, so I went to different meetings.  I stayed in touch with the people I liked from it though.  I kept what I thought would help my sobriety and I left the rest.  The miracles were pounding at the door now.  My doctor saw me for my physical and I was in perfect health.  My partner and I began discussing our future together, thinking about kids, marriage.  I wasn‚Äôt broke anymore.  I did my own taxes.  On time.  So I kept coming.

I started following through on plans.  I went to my boss‚Äôs tai chi class.  I met a friend to go hiking.  He confided that he was concerned about his own drinking, but didn‚Äôt want to go to AA.  I told him I understood, not because it was a thing to say, but because I did.  I didn‚Äôt try to change his mind, but I told him what about it had worked for me.  I told him not all of it had.  It felt good to help him.  So I kept coming.

I realized the biggest miracle had happened the other night.  I was eating pizza, playing video games with my partner, starting to feel sleepy, ready for pajamas and to snuggle into bed.  

And I realized I was something I never thought I‚Äôd be.   I was okay.  I was content.  I was grateful.  I was happy.

Happiness didn‚Äôt scream at me, it was a whisper.  It found me while I wasn‚Äôt looking for it.  I didn‚Äôt need to be happy to get sober.  I needed to be sober to get happy.  

I still feel like shit sometimes.  I still feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind sometimes.  I still hate meetings sometimes.  I still want to drink/use sometimes.  I‚Äôm still afraid sometimes.  

Sometimes those fears are loud.  But that‚Äôs okay.  It‚Äôs okay to be afraid.  I‚Äôm used to being afraid.  That‚Äôs why I drank.  And now it‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt.  Now it‚Äôs why I keep coming.",23,0

Trying to Figure Out.,15,ms2ftb,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/ms2ftb/sponsor_is_harsh_should_i_move_on_trying_to/,28,1618577364.0,"I'm trying to get to the heart of the matter regarding whether I need to find a new sponsor, or if it is just me being resistant to change. Because this isn't the first sponsor I've had. I feel that the current sponsor I have is a very fast and harsh person. I on the other hand, am more of a slow processor. When we talk, I feel like she talks circles around me and I leave the conversation feeling misunderstood and torn up. Example, someone from my past that was on my 4th step popped up in my Facebook feed about a week ago. They won money at a casino, and I felt envious. I talked to my sponsor about it, and she said to do some writing. Which I did. I had forgotten that she was on my 4th step and that at one point she threatened me and my son (who was 5 at the time). I've been praying about it, it isn't my business how that person is doing today, may the odds continue to be in their favor.  I talked to my sponsor yesterday, and she asked me how I was doing with the bad feelings. I told her that I remembered the reason why I was so disturbed by the person (spiritual axiom comes in here) and that I've been praying. I added that sometimes I struggle with praying for people that harmed me in the past, and wonder why they don't get theirs. To which she replied ""well you'll get yours then if that is the energy your putting into the Universe."" Uh, OK... and the continues on that she has thoughts like that about people sometimes also. So? Well I said I would just ""let it go,"" what I meant was that I will take her advice and continue to pray. And she misunderstood me and jumped on me about that and was like ""you're not willing to go to any lengths, you're resistant and you're not taking suggestions,"" until I pointed out to her that I didn't mean I wasn't going to take her suggestion!! OK. So I feel like she is giving me very harsh advice about things I didn't ask for on a regular basis. I know that the steps come down to us and what we are willing to do for our own recovery, but I feel like it is the way she points this out to me that feels very blaming, harsh, and like ""don't you know I'm taking my time to help you,"" type of attitude. She makes comments like ""I don't know how I got through grad school with 2 kids and sponsoring 3-4 women"" and ""you should have 3 sponsees by now"" (I had one, she relapsed and I'm looking for someone else now). I realize that my program is different than hers. I do AA and NA, I got to 2 -4 meetings a week (3 is my sweet spot) and I am also a parent, a college student, and I have a job too! This is what I can do. I'm not going to start going to meetings everyday at this point. I feel like she isn't approving of that and wants me to do more. I am OK with where I'm at, and I don't want to spread myself too thin and take more on. Writing this now makes me see that maybe I should move on to someone that is a bit less controlling.",15,0
1842,Got my 30 day chip today!,137,ms5oq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/ms5oq5/got_my_30_day_chip_today/,10,1618587277.0,"30 days. Last 5 years I truly never went 2 days without a drink. I never thought it was possible. I knew it was not possible by myself, but I was comfortable drinking. So I kept drinking. I was very comfortable identifying as an alcoholic since the beginning. It gave me a pass to drink all I want and not plan ahead. I never really thought I would live past 25, either the alcohol would kill me or I would. I've dealt with depression and anxiety all my life. I was a secluded, isolated, secret alcoholic. My friends and family loved my fun and normal drinking around them. I never drove drunk, never got into an argument or fight, never lost a job or home, never had blackouts or hangovers. And was a pleasant fun drunk. But for 12 years I couldn't stop drinking. 

I'd drink morning, day and night.  Alcohol was not fun anymore, it was a necessity. Towards the end of my last bender, drinking 2 pints of vodka a day and a few beers at night, I was ready to either end my life or my drinking. Both options were a possibility, but ending my life seemed like the easier choice. I couldn't go 4 hours without a drink.

I was scared that if I sober up, I would kill myself, and if I got even more drunk I would do it either way. I knew something was going to give. I had hit my rock bottom. I made some last minute preparations for whatever the outcome would be. And had a moment of clarity after breaking down to my husband. I was ashamed of the secret drinking and lies. I'm only as sick as my secrets, and shame thrives in secrecy. 

I found a fellowship around my neighborhood. I have gone to a meeting every day since I've stopped drinking. As an atheist, AA is a very intimidating prospect. While I do not worship a god, I'm very spiritual with the energy that's alive in the world. I'm keeping my mind open and the spiritual connection I've found in the fellowship is beyond what I can describe. And I'm very excited to learn from it and heal with it. My higher power is not fully defined yet but it's definitely alive in the fellowship. The energy left behind by my mom (who never touched an alcoholic drink), my best friend (who was an alcoholic) and my mother in law (who was sober for 45 years), is what I'm developing into my higher power. They all passed away recently and all loved me very much and each of them had a relationship with alcohol. Their energy will always be part of this world and I'm learning to let go and let them guide me.

2 days ago I got a sponsor and 3 weeks ago I started seeing a therapist. 

I'm glad to make it to 30 days, but I know that I'm just starting my journey into sobriety, and if I'm fortunate enough, this will be my continuous journey for the rest of my life. One day at a time.

Partly because I thought it was funny, but partly because I really felt like every day was a bad day.  I had so many bad days in a row, I didnt know what it was like to have good days.

When I first started coming to meetings and seeing people who were smiling and talking about how happy they were, I thought that these people were either mentally slow or lying.  I thought that the only way anyone can be that happy is because they are too stupid to know how shitty life really is.

Now at just over 7 months, I have had so many good days in a row that I cant remember having a bad day!  Life really is about my attitude.  

I used to have this nagging voice in my head every single day.  ""I hate this shit.""  ""Life sucks"".  ""Another fuckin day"".

My sponsor was one of these happy people that pissed me off.  He told me to try listing 5 things Im grateful for upon awakening.  I thought that was stupid but I would try it anyway.  Much to my surprise, it really works.  I start each day with a smile now.  Really!

One of my biggest fears that if I start dating I‚Äôll start drinking.

I studied anatomy to understand how our bodies process booze. When you drink on an empty stomach the pyloric sphincter is wide open, allowing the booze to get to the small intestine faster for quicker absorption. Booze inhibits the bodies production of ant-diuretic hormone(breaking the seal). You loose more than water in piss, you loose electrolytes, potassium, chloride, and sodium. That‚Äôs what leads to hangovers. So replace them with a Gatorade or a pedialyte. The liver burns through vitamin b12 and folic acid when processing alcohol. So we need to eat a diet rich in dark leafy greens, fruits, and fish to protect our nervous system. I know how quickly my body can process booze, I tested it for a few nights with a breathalyzer(2-3beers an hour). When you‚Äôre driving, drive with your thumbs sticking up one on the yellow line one on the white, this way and you‚Äôre definitely straight and you are less likely to get pulled over. There‚Äôs a lot of calories in beer, so you have to make sure to eat well throughout the day and hit the gym so there‚Äôs tons of room in your daily allotment of calories for your beer. Miller lite has been my poison of choice, only 96 calories a can. When you know you‚Äôre going to send it hard and the thumb trick won‚Äôt cut it. Rent a citi-bike and cycle to the bar, that way you save yourself an Uber trip. All of this thought and effort to try and mitigate the damage that booze could have on my body and life, and never once did it occur to me that I could just not drink so much. That‚Äôs how pervasive and consuming booze has been in my mind and life. It‚Äôs fucking insane. I‚Äôm two days sober as I type this, and I‚Äôm resolved to put all of that thought and energy into remaining so. I‚Äôm lucky that I haven‚Äôt seriously hurt myself or someone else with my bullshit.

Before I got sober, I went to a couple meetings and always left feeling like I didn't have a problem, because all the stories were so severe compared to mine. I guess a part of me struggles with feeling like I wasn't ""alcoholic enough"" for it and I felt stupid for being there (I absolutely am an alcoholic-one drink would never be one drink-it would always be blacking out. Toward the end, often 4-5 times a week). I know that's a dumb way of looking at it, I know people who go to meetings who never ""hit rock bottom"", I know that anyone can be an alcoholic. I just don't want to end up feeling like I don't have a problem again. Before, meetings convinced me I didn't have a problem and gave me validation to keep drinking. I guess that perspective is shifted a bit now...I don't think I'd go to a meeting now and be like ""ah yeah I wasn't that bad, off to the bar!""

Anyway, I've been sober for two years but I feel like I missed out a lot on the healing parts of getting sober. I never processed anything and I never really dealt with it, I just stopped.

I‚Äôm in my mid-late 30‚Äôs, have beautiful children, a stunning, gorgeous wife, a solid skill-set and career....but there‚Äôs a couple issues. 

1.  This is difficult to admit, but I am a raging alcoholic. The past 14-18 years have been a blur. I could justify my drinking/ drug use and say I‚Äôve done ok for myself, but I could be so much better. 

2.  I‚Äôve been through the gamut of drug addiction...coke, crack, MDMA, amphetamine, meth, hallucinogens, RC‚Äôs, and enough Oxy to kill a god damn rain forest, and of course, my old friend...booze. I‚Äôve lost great jobs, snorted a bunch of oxy before my children‚Äôs birth...I feel like a fucking loser. 

I‚Äôve pretty much quit every other drug, no matter how hellish the w/d, but I‚Äôm still stuck on whiskey, double IPA‚Äôs, and the occasional meet up with Tina. 

I absolutely hate how hard I‚Äôm slamming booze and I can quote my wife saying, ‚ÄúYour drinking is scaring me.‚Äù  I‚Äôve never been violent nor have I ever raised my voice to her. We have a very good marriage, but from 10:30-1am, I‚Äôm in blackout territory.

But boy was I wrong.  7 years later, and things are awesome.  Don't get me wrong.  Not all of my dreams came true.  I still have struggles.  Life is hard and crappy sometimes.  I've had to fight, and I've had to have some come to Jesus moments along the way.

But man.  Life really means something now.  I feel the joy of being alive.  I feel love.  I feel peace.  It took some figuring out in order to get here, it took some growing up and learning... but it wasn't that bad.  All I needed was to give myself a little chance.

I dunno.  I don't want to make it seem like life is suddenly magical just because we stop drinking.  It's not usually like that.  But there are just moments where I can't even believe how wonderful everything is.  It's like I could shout it from the rooftops.

I was at the supermarket (grocery store) tonight and was scanning my bottle of wine and pack of sushi at the self-checkout. I do this basically every night on my way home from the gym. The workers all kind of know me since I'm always there, and are very friendly.

Tonight, the woman who checked my ID joked 'you're always here at night buying the wine aren't you!'. I laughed it off and started blushing with total embarrassment. My first thought when I got to the car was 'Im going to have to start a rotation of visiting different stores, so it's not this obvious'. Then I realized, 'shit, this isn't normal'. 

My drinking habits have ebbed and flowed over time. From binge drinking 5 nights a week in university, to being a social recluse for a few years and drinking alone. I'm more social these days, but my drinking has escalated in the past year. 

I drink a bottle of wine every night, without fail. On weekends it's more like 2 bottles a night. I've tried to resist buying alcohol at night, but it gets to about 8pm and I have this restless feeling, like an itch than only alcohol can get rid off. The urge is usually worse when I'm feeling lonely. I'm drinking a bottle of wine as I type this.

I don't think friends/family suspect a thing, because I hide it pretty well. I don't get hungover and I'm very fit/active. I'm fully functional at work, and it's a job that requires a lot of responsibility. I've also been told by friends that I seem sober when I'm drunk, which I suspect is due to tolerance. When I'm staying at my parents house, I hide bottles in my room and then take them to the recycling centre when my parents are out. If I had to guess, I'd say I may be a functional alcoholic.

But I'm well aware that functional alcoholics don't always stay functional. The issues caused from drinking are subtle, but they are there. My finances aren't as good as they should be, and I started seeing a few Sugar Daddies to get them back to a reasonable state. I feel constantly guilty for living a double life (both with the drinking and sleeping with rich men for money). 

TLDR: 

A supermarket worker joked about my drinking and it may have changed my life for the better.

I've decided to try an AA meeting, to get support from people who won't judge me. 

If anyone has any anecdotes of their first meeting, I would really appreciate it as motivation for me to go. I am serious about getting better",37,0

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to put this but the anxiety & emotional instability of withdrawals are hitting me so hard that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to anyone verbally just now, so I hope you guys will forgive me if it‚Äôs out of place. It‚Äôs 4:30 in the morning where I am and I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôve been a pretty steady drinker for about 12 years now, going into sobriety now & then by sheer will power because some life circumstance necessitated it but always slipping back into the old habits. And each time it got bad it was worse than the last. Two weeks ago I was at 24+ standard drinks a day, drinking as soon as my eyes opened throughout the day until falling asleep. Then one morning I awoke coughing up blood. I was so dizzy & disoriented I had difficulty walking to the liquor store, I could barely stand upright or lift my head to see the signals at the city crosswalks. Little money left, nothing left to pawn, rent due in a few days, bills to pay, and there I was spending what little money I had on more alcohol. I can‚Äôt really describe the depth of anguish I felt then, it‚Äôs without a doubt the most terrified & alone I‚Äôve ever felt. With the taste of blood in my mouth I guess I realized I was gonna die pretty soon if I kept this up, & I decided that that was about as near to rock bottom as I cared to get. Because I‚Äôm not ready to die, I‚Äôve still got things to do. So over the last two weeks I‚Äôve been drinking less & less each day & it‚Äôs been a living hell. I‚Äôm sure you guys know the drill. Shakes, paranoia, fever, dizzy spells, hallucinations, irritation, irrational fears, etc etc. The works. 

But today, or rather, yesterday, marks the first day that I didn‚Äôt have a drop. The cravings have been relentless. In two days I start in-patient treatment for the first time in my life, because obviously I can‚Äôt do this alone, although like many I believed I was different than all the others & that I was capable of doing it alone. But I‚Äôm not. So I just have to make it two more days. I know I am capable but time is passing at a snail‚Äôs pace & I thought I might seek some relief in sharing my struggle here. 

I discovered this subreddit tonight & I wanted to say thank you to everyone that has posted or commented. It‚Äôs given me a lot of hope & strength to read what others have been through & how they recovered. Thanks so much guys.",46,0

1882,First post.,26,mxtw2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/mxtw2h/first_post/,6,1619301107.0,"Hi everyone! As the title says, this is my first post on this subreddit. I have been really inspired by all the thoughtful responses and discussions here as I‚Äôve been silently watching for awhile now. I am very ashamed of my alcoholism so it makes it difficult to talk about, even write about. I  have had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I am an alcoholic. No matter how many times I woke up not remembering the night before, no matter how many times I woke up on the floor surrounded by empty nip bottles, no matter how many times I put myself in incredibly dangerous situations while drunk that could have cost myself or (even worse) someone else their life.. I told myself that I didn‚Äôt have a problem.

I am 28 and my heaviest days of drinking have been through my 20‚Äôs up until this point.  I suffered in multiple abusive relationships that led me to drink my feelings away, but it never helped. I also suffer from anorexia and drinking was a way to curb my appetite and not eat. For that reason, the eating disorder part of me tried to justify drinking and I was in major denial. Part of my denial also stemmed from being able to function and hide it so well. If I functioned so well, it made it harder to believe I had an actual problem. But yet, I would work drunk. I would go out to bars after work and get more drunk and not know how I got home. I woke up in the woods a couple times. I‚Äôd hide bottles. I‚Äôd go to the liquor store sometimes more than once a day.. I am sure you all know the habits of an alcoholic all too well.

They checked my blood alcohol level and it said 0.00 that was the first time  in idk how long I could say that I was completely sober.

When I went in I was at my most Vulnerable state I have ever been in and it was the most traumatizing moment of my whole life.

Today I have a lot of emotions to think where I once was a year ago. How I had let alcohol take over my life and keep me locked up in this cage I could never get out of. It put me in a place where I weak, scared, and had no voice.

When I went into the hospital I was looked at and treated like someone who was on drugs and was told over and over again I was a heroin addict because how sick I was. Shaking, unable to breathe or stand on my own the nurse could careless. After getting assessed by the nurse they took me to a room to lay down on a bed

This was the beginning of Covid and the hospital was out of masks. They had paper towels folded in half with rubber bands stapled to the sides. They put one on me when I first got there. I already couldn‚Äôt breathe as it was and they tell me to lay down to put in an IV. When I laid down the paper towels went into my mouth and nose. I was suffocating 

I sat up so I could breathe. The nurse called for for someone to come put in the IV. When someone came to help she got on the bed and held the mask over my mouth and nose making it so I couldn‚Äôt breathe at all. 

As I laid there in tears thinking this was how I was going to die. Thinking I put myself here. Making myself so weak and vulnerable I could not fight back. It was the scariest moment of my life.

She held the mask over my face she yelled ‚ÄúLay the fuck down! We‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic you little shit!‚Äù I had used my last drop of energy trying to sit up so holding me down wasn‚Äôt something she needed to do. I wasn‚Äôt fighting because I couldn‚Äôt. I was on the verge of passing out so she climbed off the table so I could breathe. Heroin

After multiple try‚Äôs they finally got the IV in. The nurse continued to say I was on heroin and treated me like it too. She asked if I was cold because I was shaking, but then told me that sucks. A doctor would come in and turn off the lights so I could rest and she would come in the room just to turn them on because a drug addict doesn‚Äôt deserve sleep. After being there for what felt like a lifetime, I finally had stop shaking and had gained some strength back. When the nurse came back in and started telling me that I was on Heroin again I used everything I had in me to yell at her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do fucking heroin!!!!‚Äù She called me a lair and left the room. 

She came back into the room and told me she had talked to my husband. My husband told her that I had a substance abuse problem. She then yelled at me saying that when someone says they have a substance abuse problem that means drugs not alcohol. She told me that alcohol is not a substance. Never once did she apologize. Never once did she even look like she felt bad. It was seriously the scariest moment of my whole life. 

Fucked up people are out there and will take advantage of you when ur that weak it‚Äôs soooo horrible. But everyone has a different path to sobriety but I pray to god yours is nothing like mine. You just gotta tell yourself your better then all this!! Don‚Äôt put yourself in the position I did, don‚Äôt make urself almost die to get sober. Do it for you, do it to be happy again, do it to feel good inside and out! I can honestly say sobriety is a beautiful thing and will make life so much better you just gotta believe in yourself.... and I believe in you... you can do this just be strong",19,0

Thursday morning she came in my office with her insurance provider on the phone. She was calling to find out about in-home treatment programs, which her insurance would not cover, but she was determined to try and make happen. The provider picked up on her level of intoxication and told her she needed to go to ER immediately for fear of complications from withdrawal. I dropped what I was doing and we went straight to the ER. I knew in my heart this was the opportunity to get her into treatment. 

The ER was busy and we waited over 6 hours to be seen, all the while she was telling me to go home and that she would take an Uber back. When she was called in to do blood work I got on the phone with her insurance provider to find out about in-network treatment providers. I learned that the in-home service she wanted to try used medical billing codes the provider did not accept, so we ruled that option out quickly. I knew about a treatment center that offered detox and has a great track record of helping people build a foundation for success in 12-step work. They were in-network! 

I reached out to friends and family. This is the place, the time is now, we need your support. Everyone was on board. Finally, we both met with the doctor who was astonished at her BAC, over .4 after several hours of not drinking. She was about to recommend treatment when I interjected. I found a place where she can go, beds are available. Here‚Äôs why in-home will not work, insurance limitations. Doctor was immediately on board and brought in the social worker. Together they were magnificent and I‚Äôm so grateful for the compassion and coordination they provided. She didn‚Äôt resist and the decision was ultimately her own. 

The following day was tough. She was given some Librium to help with her withdrawals and spent the day packing. We took the ride together, along with our 8 m/o puppy, and got her admitted Friday afternoon. There‚Äôs no contact for the first week while she is in detox, and although I am grateful for this opportunity, my heart hurts for the pain she must be feeling. 

So now it‚Äôs just me, the dog and H.P.. I‚Äôm here to tell you this story because I‚Äôm hopeful, yet I‚Äôm not attached to the outcome. I accept the things I cannot change, and my courage to change the things I can has given me a spiritual freedom that has allowed me to show up for this person with whom I love deeply, without judgment. I will continue to work on myself because it is the only thing I can really do for others. I feel the pain and sadness of longing for my companion, but I know that she has not been able to show up for life, and even when she is near she is not present. I will not resist the feelings I am having, I will welcome them with an open heart. 

Don‚Äôt give up. There is hope. This program works if you work it, and you work it cause you‚Äôre worth it.

I'm no expert on how this program works, and I know I am far from perfect in how I work my program...but the one thing I wanted to share with anyone struggling with alcoholism, is that there IS hope, and you are worth it.

‚ÄúGo to 90 meetings in 90 days. It‚Äôll work itself out.‚Äù

*Yes, I have a sponsor. He only says ‚Äúgot to 90 in 90.‚Äù Is there anything beyond that answer?*

‚ÄúWork the steps then. It‚Äôll work itself out. And get a sponsor.‚Äù

*Yes, I‚Äôm working the steps, i have a sponsor, I am on step 4. But I don‚Äôt know how to correct a couple problems today and I was curious if anyone else had experience with this?*

‚ÄúWell, just do 90 meetings in 90 days. And get a sponsor.‚Äù

*I am! I am doing 90 in 90, have a sponsor, am working the steps.*

‚ÄúWell just do 90 meetings in 90 days, get a sponsor and work the steps. That‚Äôs how it works. It‚Äôll work itself out.‚Äù

*Good advice! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing! But what do I do today? For handling tough stuff? Does anyone have any experience with how to handle day-to-difficulties while I‚Äôm doing these things? Like navigating employment, relationships and such?*

‚ÄúWell just do 90 meetings in 90 days.‚Äù

*Okay. I see a general theme here. So, I just got stabbed in the neck. What should I do?*

‚ÄúGet a sponsor, work the steps. The arterial bleeding will work itself out.‚Äù

On days one and two, it was a rough mix of the physical pains from the withdraw symptoms. My head was extremely cloudy, unfocused, and just generally sad for what I had lost. I had some very bad thoughts at the start of it; drinking and possible suicide, so for those two days I chose to stay with a friend from work, that is also in recovery, to help me get through it. 


On day three, my body pains were mostly gone, I could finally put some damn food in my shrinking stomach, and the clouds parted enough for my head to be able to think more clearly. The past week leading up to this point ruled the day as far as my thoughts went. My actions and losses sort of stuff, so focusing on work was difficult.


Yesterday was a rough one. I thought of drinking most of the day due to several situations that sparked anxiety. I could feel my chest tighten, heart rate went up and all I wanted to do in those moments was drink or run away to drink. The first situation was with my now ex-girlfriend. We had a conversation that ended with a statement that has me worrying about her safety. When we met, she was in a phase in her life that put her in unsafe situations. I know she does not want to go there, but I can see it easily going there. The second situation was a birthday party. My brother asked me to go so I went. Plus, it was something to get me out of the house and around people. Everyone at the party was drinking except for a prego lady, and the kids. Fresh off a conversation with the ex-girlfriend, and alcohol everywhere; my drinking senses were on like DEFCON two. Luckily, my brother was there. The idea of disappointing him helped keep me in line. By mid-day I needed some help, so I went to see a friend to help calm me down. She met me at a coffee shop, and we spent the rest of the day life and random things.


Here we are at day five. I think I have a solid plan for a sober day. I have a list of things I need to do to help keep my mind and body busy. I have already gone to a meeting and asked my sponsor for some step work to do. If things start to go south with my feelings of being alone and sad, my friend from the other night is open to me just coming over to chill, until it passes. I think I have today.


Thanks for letting me share. I always feel better when I come here and read some of the posts and comments.


TL:DR
Made it to day five. Day/Two were filled with withdraws. Day three withdraw recovery and was filled with sadness. Day four negative comment from ex and a birthday party that had me craving alcohol for most of the day. I have a solid plan for day five. I made it to a meeting and got some step work.",128,0

If we still cling to something we will not let go, we ask God to help us be willing.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 76

When I had taken my Fifth Step, I became aware
 that all my defects of character stemmed from my need to feel secure and loved.  To use my will alone to work on them would have been trying obsessively to solve the problem.  In the Sixth Step I intensified the action I had taken in the first three Steps ‚Äì meditating on the Step by saying it over and over, going to meetings, following my sponsor's suggestions, reading and searching within myself.  During the first three years of sobriety I had a fear of entering an elevator alone.  One day I decided I must walk through this fear.  I asked for God's help, entered the elevator, and there in the corner was a lady crying.  She said that since her husband had died she was deathly afraid of elevators.  I forgot my fear and comforted her.  This spiritual experience helped me to see how willingness was the key to working the rest of the Twelve Steps to recovery.  God helps those who help themselves.

Things have improved for me, both physically and mentally in this second week. During that first week I was a total mess mentally. Besides the cloudiness of the alcohol leaving my system, I was consumed with remorse, self-pity, and poor thoughts that in no way help me fix the relationships I damaged. Once I got up off my ass, I made it to a few meetings and picked out a new sponsor. I guess you can say that my first one was more of a temporary thing. I picked my first one out of desperation and it turned out that he was not quite the right fit for me conversationally. Now that I am familiar with most of the folks in my AA group, I was able to find a sponsor that was more of a fit for me motivation/conversational wise. He has gotten me through step four, begrudgingly at times, and we are about to start five. I did notice while making my moral inventory some emergences of negative patterns and thought processes that have dominated most of the conflicts in my life. The realization of some of these things was like a light coming on in a dark cluttered room. Hopefully as I progress further along in the steps and with some more time under my belt, I can clean up that cluttered room, fix the thought process that have been driving me in the wrong direction, and repair the damages I have done to others.

How do I reconnect to a higher power with love and care, to a god that let all these things happen to me. Im bitter perhaps, i just want to be happy and not feel like i need to get drunk etc.

This disease is full of sneaky and manipulative behavior that hurts others.  That and a pack of lies.

When I was at my worst, even when I wanted to quit, I just thought I can't let this go.  My best efforts to quit on my own always led straight back to the bottle.  I remember thinking, you're not going to take this away from me, you'll have to pry it out of my dead hands.    I don't know how else to describe it, but I just wasn't willing to live without.  I'm not giving this up!  Not for me and not for anybody.

I finally hit rock bottom, that point where the alcohol had taken everything from me.  Things like dignity, credibility, and health.  I woke at 4 AM, went online and figured out how to get to a nearby meeting.  It started at 7:30 AM.  I emailed, I'd be late to work that day - which was good since I wreaked of liquor.   I said to myself, ""I'm done, I'm willing to do what's suggested and I'll try this earnestly for a year.""  For me that meant 1 meeting a day, and read the book and listen to AA podcasts in the car.  The disease tried to talk me out of it the whole time.  That was more than 3 years ago.

This paragraph from page 64 in the AA 12 and 12 resonated with my experience and kept me going.

>When men and women pour so much alcohol into them-selves that they destroy their lives, they commit a most unnatural act. Defying their instinctive desire for self-preservation,  they  seem  bent  upon  self-destruction.  They  work  against  their  own  deepest  instinct.  As  they  are  humbled  by  the  terrific  beating  administered  by  alcohol,  the  grace  of   God  can  enter  them  and  expel  their  obsession.  Here  their powerful instinct to live can cooperate fully with their Creator‚Äôs desire to give them new life. For nature and God alike abhor suicide",28,0

And he well knows that his own life has been made richer, as an extra dividend of giving to another without any demand for a return.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 69

The concept of giving without strings was hard to understand when I first came into the program.  I was suspicious when others wanted to help me.  I thought, 'What do they want in return?'  But I soon learned the joy of helping another alcoholic and I understood why they were there for me in the beginning.  My attitudes changed and I wanted to help others.  Sometimes I became anxious, as I wanted them to know the joys of sobriety, that life can be beautiful.  When my life is full of a loving God of my understanding and I give that love to my fellow alcoholic, I feel a special richness that is hard to explain.

I'm a 28 year old female and still in the first few days of my sobriety. I've been struggling with addiction to alcohol and codeine/ibuprofen pills for years now. I'm feeling very lonely right now and don't know where to turn in regards to finding support. I'd appreciate any advice I could get in terms of getting a Whatsapp or email friend or sponsor to help me navigate these early days of my sobriety. Thank you all and any help you could give would really help me right now.

It led me onto a bender, after relapsing (had been sober 3 months) just prior to attempting, and then to quit with rehab shortly after.

It feels like my brain got rewired in rehab and with quitting alcohol and cannabis, it was a 7 week program. Basic DBT style with CBT integrated and trauma education, lots of classes and lots of other people with similar struggles. I felt lonely as always (less now) but also just felt a part of something. I had been on disability for 1.5 years so classes felt more purposeful. I did counseling the 5 years earlier for trauma.

In the time I was off work, I was put off for a bipolar 1 diagnosis which landed up being a misdiagnosis. It was corrected on the psych ward after my attempt as they thought the treatment was causing my low. I was taken off my 8 different meds slowly and a new psychiatrist took me on. I guess now I'm borderline traits but don't fit the full check boxes for the personality disorder. I don't care anymore really, I'm better but I don't know if I'm ""there"" or ever will be.

I'm struggling with serious physical illness now despite taking such good care of myself the last year. Feels like a slap in the face, but years could be catching up to me plus some heavy antipsychotics that weren't really needed in my case. And my relationship is struggling, he also is abstinent which really helps. But he's moody and it sets me off, just my mood gets so low. And I'm already struggling with pain, difficulty breathing, and fevers for months now. I'm exhausted and I hate being critiqued when I'm so down. 

At the same time he brings me to the appointments and is my main caregiver. Life is such a bitch, I love being sober and better. But I'm always so afraid of slipping, and sometimes I feel like I'm on the path too.

I don't even crave alcohol or cannabis, I'm not suicidal, I'm desperately trying to live for once in my life. I have occasional food binges lately. I lost 50lbs from being obese, now I'm overweight but can't lose weight very easily when my body is completely sedentary. It's just not a real priority, yet I still get so down about it.

It's weird that it can feel so frightening even when your doing so comparably good compared to your previous life. I feel like I might break again, relapse, and I have to hold my breath so I don't. I don't know how to maintain, my tools don't feel good enough.",37,0

Ok so they don't Identify as alcoholics whats the big deal? Well it goes deeper than that unfortunately.

The recovery coaches I hear in the North East do not respect the AA program. For example they will suggest, harm reduction methods, other ways of getting sober outside of AA, moderation etc.

They actively seek out sponsees though they are actually clients to them. Whatever recovery/rehab center they belong to pays these coaches to be a mentor or ""sponsor."" It's almost like a pyramid scheme because then the client becomes a coach and recruits more newly sober people for the rehab center.

When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally and physically.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 64

It is very difficult for me to come to terms with my spiritual illness because of my great pride, disguised by my material successes and my intellectual power.  Intelligence is not incompatible with humility, provided I place humility first.  To seek prestige and wealth is the ultimate goal for many in the modern world.  To be fashionable and to seem better than I really am is a spiritual illness.  To recognize and to admit my weaknesses is the beginning of good spiritual health.  It is a sign of spiritual health to be able to ask God every day to enlighten me, to recognize His will, and to have the strength to execute it.  My spiritual health is excellent when I realize that the better I get, the more I discover how much help I need from others.

&#x200B;

When I lived with my parents i stole countless bottles worth of alcohol from them, and even stole money from them to buy alcohol once I turned 18. They caught me several times, but there are many other times I got away with it, and I cant bare to tell them, Im sure theyre already aware and got to the point where they didnt think telling me off was going to do anything, as it hadnt in the past. I try to buy my parents treats like coffees and snacks whenever I see them, and I buy them really fancy alcohol on special occasions (like ¬£50 bottles of stuff) to try and make up for it. 

&#x200B;

I worked it out today after talkig to my girlfriend, and in 2019 I drank a bottle of gin each week, which works out to about ¬£1000 a year on drink. 

&#x200B;

My grades are slipping / not as good as they could  be because im hungover a lot / start drinking at 7/8 most nights. I spend way too much than i can afford on alcohol, I still go through about a bottle of gin every 2 weeks at the moment. 

&#x200B;

My girlfriend keeps telling me if I dont stop she will break up with me, she doesnt want to but I dont blame her, she tried to tell me to stop drinking in the past but I went behind her back multiple times and drink when she told me not to to try and help me, so now she doesnt bother to try and help anymore, and who can blame her.

&#x200B;

I got drunk with her and her flatmates last night, and it ended up in a shouting match between me and my girlfriend, as Im aggressive and overly paranoid and selfish when im drunk. My girlfirend told me today that every single big arguement we have had in our relationship has happened when im drunk, and it just kind of hit me how much happier and healthier I would, and everyone I have a relationship with, if i stop drinking, and only socially drink and control my intake a lot more. 

&#x200B;

I've tried to access therapy on the NHS for depression and worrying etc, but as soon as I told them I struggle with drink they said they wouldnt help until I was sober, as therapy doesnt tend to work with people who are alcoholics. Ive been in therapy and on medication for 8 months before, but the therapy didnt work, maybe because I wasnt engaging, and the medication just made me fall asleep all the time. 

&#x200B;

I dont really know what to do but i need help and advice, and i guess i feel more comfortable asking for help on the internet than people I know IRL.

&#x200B;

I'm only 21, I recently got offered an amazing possible work placement in neuroscience research, I have a girlfriend who loves me and trys to help me, and amazing friends. I have a great life ahead of me, but only if I manage to sort out my alcoholism, and Im terrified I wont be able to.",10,0

Then the days started adding up, the quantities got larger until it became my biggest binge to date that regrettably seeped into the beginning of the work week. Like I am literally appalled at how much alcohol I consumed, and the entire time I was miserable. And it brings out all of my worst qualities and hinders all the good ones, literally like dr jekyl and Hyde or w/e their names were lmao. 

So went to my home group meeting last night, went to some more today, before I go to my home group meeting again today. Talked to my sponsor who said focusing on the steps would help. Talked to other members. Looking into outpatient treatment options in my city b/c determined to never let that happen again, don‚Äôt have one foot out the door this time, not a single doubt in my mind that I‚Äôm an alcoholic. So strong-willed in my planning but know that this is something I can never be complacent about again for the rest of my life. 

Have the first 24 (+ a few) hours (again), luckily don‚Äôt think I have been binging like this long enough to have severe withdrawals (the worst of it was a bit of mental fog and elevated body temp). But I am no longer in denial that I am going to lose everything in my life to this disease if I don‚Äôt come back everyday. 

This is more of a vent than anything else, I‚Äôve literally wanted to do nothing but talk to other members today, but also wanted to say to anyone who just got here / anyone who has recently relapsed, we are in this together, it‚Äôs not a moral failing, we‚Äôre just sick people trying to get better. The first 24 hours is always the hardest for me bc I‚Äôm drowning in regret and self-loathing. Maybe a drink would take that feeling away for just a brief moment. And then when that feeling wore off, I would be back to being miserable, and my brain would be telling me to have another after another after another. I was sober just last week, I remember how much better sobriety feels in comparison to going back out.",10,0

2021,Today marks 4 months!,43,nog8x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/nog8x7/today_marks_4_months/,4,1622396483.0,"Today marks 4 months of sobriety. 4months ago I decided to stop any substance abuse I was inflicting myself; primarily Alcohol but also cut cold turkey on weed.

It's been a bumpy ride but I have been learning to accept, let go, forgive and repent. 4 essential things that have taught me to face myself. Letting feelings I had repressed through alcohol or ignore through smoking weed, was very confrontational and made me realise how my emotions were directed in all the wrong directions. My impatience, arrogance and neglect of others was deeply rooted in resentments I had towards people in my past, which the ones in my present had to suffer for. I didn't know how to channel my anger, not realising it came from a place of fear, into the right direction. 

I feel much lighter emotionally. Not drinking wasn't the solution, but sure as hell helped me give the energy and focus to direct my thoughts in the right direction.

I spend far to long expressing frustrations and wanting to passively aggressively let the world know how wrong they were about things. Truth is, I had to learn that it was none of my business what other people thought or believed in. My insecurities pushed me into thinking that I needed to be in control of everything and everyone around me. 

I no longer wake up with an anxiety of the unknown and the fear of not remembering who I hurt the day prior to my binge drinking. The constant numbing of my emotions making me seem cold and distant. At times I just didn't want to feel responsible for the pain I was causing and a vicious cycle of numbing myself was the easiest way to ignore my wrong doings. 

I can say that today, 4 months into my sobriety, I am proud of myself and the direction i'm heading. I feel much more in-tune with my defects and resentments. Days are far from perfect but I am so grateful for the people that supported me along the way. I have a wonderful family that despite all the pain I caused has stood by me. My mom and my dad have been amazing the past years and I love them so much for all the blessings they have given me. My siblings, despite missing them dearly, have given me the strength and resilience to not give up. My friends checking up on me are truly the heart beat of what makes all of this even more worth it! Last and far from least, Deni, My beauty, my strength, my weakness and my life; you are the one that's seen the ugly up close and stuck by me no matter what! You have shown me that love can be unconditional and given me the hope I needed to carry on in the right direction! Thank you my love for being all that you are and I can't wait to keep discovering each other in the infinite variables life has to offer. 

I have been given a gift and I intend to embrace it fully! Thank you and i'm grateful for anyone that has read this! One day at a time! <3",43,0

She drank my whole life until I left home at sixteen to go live my dad.  I flew to Massachusetts where she lived and one night she was liquored up when a senseless argument ensued.  Whatever it was about I can't recall, but she insisted that I was crazy.  She insisted we drive Mass General hospital late in the night for a psychological evaluation to prove how crazy I was.   It's hard to recall now, but I remember the two of us sitting with a doctor who was trying to make an assessment.    I believe it didn't take him long to figure out ""someone"" had been drinking.  He asked me to step out of the room, and the next thing I recall we were driving home without saying a word about it, that night or ever again.

I wasn't the drunk person that night, but I drank my way right out of college.  I always told myself, I wasn't a hateful crazy drunk person like my mom.  I was different because I had control and drank socially, for fun.  In spite of the insanity of my childhood, I drank most of my adult life too.   I held onto concepts like ""I don't have the problems that other people do"" or ""I'm not hurting anyone"" or ""I still have a job, so I can't be that bad"".   For a while maybe those things where true.  But I lived with a constant remorse about situations that I got into while drinking.   Later on having a family, I held onto my wrong thinking.  Lies told me by my addiction that justified my sad existence.

I came to understand that I WAS hurting people.  People that loved me, or wanted to anyway.  One evening my son came into the room.  He said, ""I can't stand listening to the arguing anymore, the two of you are just talking in circles about nothing whatsoever it doesn't even make any sense.  You're just saying the same things over and over""   He didn't call me crazy, but he would have had every right to.  He did pour all the liquor down the sink that night.

I went to AA the first thing the next day and it's been more than 3 years since.  My mom died that way.   I've come to accept that she did the best she could and I believe her childhood was worse than mine.   I'm glad that I'm not that crazy drunk parent anymore.  Since then I've learned that everyone who comes into AA has their own story, but they all begin with willingness and honesty.  I'm also glad I finally had the incentive and the courage to follow through with AA and get my life back.

I have made a string of bad mistakes in the last 6 years and was never able to be the person that I should have or promised to be. 

So, she has had enough and is divorcing me. We are still living together because it is a financially viable option. I enjoy it because I still get to see my daughter every day and spend time with her. Also, my wife and I are still being intimate with one another. I enjoy that, but I know that it will not make separating any easier once it comes time. That is especially difficult. 

Regardless, I know that I have to stay sober for myself. I can't just get sober because I am about to lose all of my stuff. As I stated before, my wife and I still live with one other. Through this program, I have been able to see the error of my ways, I have been able to be civil, ask God to remove my self-bondage, and serve those around me. This is an especially trying time in my life, but through AA, I've been able to handle it better than I could have ever imagined. 

I have treated her so badly, so I suppose the best that I can do is to try and do right by her for the last little bit of time that we are together.

My sponsor has 5 years sober and shes always been very open and honest about what she goes through, which is why I love our relationship so much. We mainly focus on emotional sobriety, and meeting every couple of weeks to go over the work she gives me.

She just called me to let me know she will no longer be in A.A. She's had these feelings for the last month and feels no anxiety about it. She feels god is calling her to explore different avenues and she'd like to take over control of her life instead of others telling her what to do.

So she'll be exploring other recovery programs like Recovery Dharma, Smart Recovery,  and intensive therapy.

She said we could still work together kind of as a women mentorship. It would look the same, except she will no longer have an A.A sponsor or go to meetings (sometimes she will.)

I'm sad for selfish reasons because I love her so much and dont know anyone quite like her, except for my gransponsor, her old sponsor. I'm considering continuing the work we do together, and getting an A.A sponsor when god sees fit.

Is this troubling? I had a long talk with my sponsee sister and we were saying we agree that A.A is not the only way to stay sober. We appreciate it so much, but cant get down with the ""A.A or die"" mentality.

Sometimes writing is an easier start. Currently, doing either is more of an issue than I'd like it to be. I have a sponsor, have worked the steps and am coming up on 18months sober. I don't feel like drinking... yet. I do however feel like isolating. Like some of my character defects are stronger than they have been in awhile. I truly believe that alcohol is just a symptom of my disease. I found a home in AA because it does so much more than just keep me sober. I am feeling a little lost these days. Unmotivated. Overwhelmed. Depressed. Even slightly discontent and resentful at times. Like the issues that fueled my drinking are bothering me more and more. The two big things at the moment that are eating at me are program related. First being that I has discussed working for someone I am very close with maybe 9 months ago. We were both very interested in the idea at the time but he had to put it on the back burner given the companies financial situation. Just last week he brought up the idea again very suddenly and asked how soon I might have been able to start. I couldn't give him an answer as I had not thought about it for months. After mulling it over, I've decided that it is not the right move for me. I've realized I was interested when we first discussed it for the wrong reasons. I also have a tendency to say yes and help wherever and whenever I can even if it isn't the responsible thing for me to do. I am quick to put the problems of others ahead of my own so I can avoid dealing with mine. It's a coping mechanism I developed when I was drinking.

The second issue is a little more concerning. I signed up to chair a Saturday meeting about 6 months ago. It was one I went to often enough at the time but haven't been frequenting as more of the meetings I was going to pre-covid opened back up. I'm always a bit nervous when I have a service commitment. A little more so about this one as I haven't been attending recently. I sign up because it is a healthy way of getting uncomfortable.  I spoke with another AA who I know attends the meeting earlier in the say about needing to get keys or set up. It's at the same location my home group is at so I could have easily picked up keys from a number of people. My sponsor included. To make a long story shorter, the meeting time had been moved up from an 8:30 time slot to 8:00 and I had not heard about it. I got out of the shower last night at 8:05 and had a missed call from the guy I spoke with earlier. I immediately figured that the meeting time must have changed and checked the app to find it had. I felt terrible immediately. That sinking feeling of fear and shame dropped my stomach to my feet. I didn't know whether to show up at the meeting late or just to apologize knowing that someone had covered and the meeting would go on without me just fine. I panicked and decided to send the text. If I didn't have better tools for coping with these ""speedbumps"" in life, my instinct is to just bail. Run, hide, ignore, isolate. Honestly, if I didn't know people from this meeting from other meetings, the temptation to never go back to this one in particular would be very appealing. As that is not the case, I'm left with the sickening idea of just abandoning the program entirely. Over one simple mistake part of me wants to throw the whole thing away. I'm sick and I despise this feeling. I know what I have to do is just show up next Saturday and do the next right thing. I will, I just feel terrible about it.

I'm going to talk to my sponsor about both things. He never pushed me but thought the job opportunity was a cool one when we discussed it awhile back. He's in my home group so will inevitably hear about how I missed the meeting last night regardless. I know we have these layers of accountability to keep us honest, sober and healthy. It just sucks thinking that it might be the main reason I am going to have the conversation. That given my will, I might just run away. Another way to sum up how I've been feeling lately is that I have many of the answers but I'm struggling with committing to things.

Thanks for letting me vent.",17,0

Self-searching is the means by which we bring new vision, action, and grace to bear upon the dark and negative side of our natures.  With it comes the development of that kind of humility that makes it possible for us to receive God's help... we find that bit by bit we can discard the old life - the one that did not work - for a new life that can and does work under any conditions whatever.

- AS BILL SEES IT, pp. 10, 8

I have been given a daily reprieve contingent upon my spiritual condition, provided I seek progress, not perfection.  To become ready for change, I practice willingness, opening myself to possibilities of change.  If I realize there are defects that hinder my usefulness in A.A. and toward others, I become ready by meditating and receiving direction.  'Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely' ( Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 58).  To let go and let God, I need only surrender my old ways to Him; I no longer fight nor do I try to control, but simply believe that, with God's help, I am changed and affirming this belief makes me ready.  I empty myself to be full of awareness, light, and love, and I am ready to face each day with hope.

My husband and I were daily drinkers, who would have knock down drag out fights while drunk. On the night of our bottom we had a particularly horrible and physical fight. I told him either we got to AA or get divorced. We went to our first meeting the next day. Some incredible women bought me a big book and give me their numbers. Ive been sober ever since. (my husband relapsed a few days before our 1 year, but he sobered up the next day and has now been sober 5 years). 

In these past 6 years life has had some major ups and down. The downs: my mom and aunt died, my dad continued to use and drink, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, I lost a pregnancy and suffered infertility. The ups: I‚Äôm still married to the love of my life and we have never had a physical fight after our bottom (honestly we rarely fight at all), my career thrived, we bought a house, and the biggest blessing is I gave birth to our son 2 months ago! Through all of this my sobriety has always been my top priority and the foundation on which I built me life. 

For anyone still struggling just know there is hope. I never thought I would get sober, I thought there was no hope for me. AA saved me and taught me how to be a grown up. Here are a few tips that helped me stay sober.

1. Say the serenity pray over and over till the cravings pass (they always pass). 
2.volunteers for things in AA meets that keep you accountable.
3. Doing 90 in 90 
4. No matter how many years you have keep going to 1 meeting a week bear minimum (preferably more)

I haven't gone more than maybe 2 days as long as I can remember. I've definitely enjoyed waking up hangover free without immediately worrying about what I said or did the night before. I'm more productive and my will power seems to gave grown even more. I'm struggling with my relationship though. We actually seem to be getting closer with every day that she comes home to me just being a normal person but at the same time I still struggle with worry. She spends all her time at male friend's home with her kids every holiday and chance she gets. She snap chats him from morning until night and has been keeping it secret. I don't blame her for any of it and am not surprised, I know I deserve it and am not mad at all. Humiliated, embarrassed, ashamed, repentant yeah but I don't have any anger over it. It does hurt though and before I stopped drinking her spending so much time with others was my excuse to get blackout drunk on more than one occasion but now that it's no longer an option I don't know what to do. I keep occupied and try to keep from thinking about it, also i've finally realized that insecurity has been a major flaw in me for a long time. Has anyone else gone through anything similar? I love this girl and we have a family, I want to be there for them more than anything, to make amends and because well, they make me happy. I just worry that all these feelings i'm holding in are going to make me miserable and I don't want to put anyone through that. I also don't have any definitive prove she's actually cheating so i'm trying to stay logical about it but everytime she's texting one of them or at their house until almost 11 p.m taking shots, making sure she looks nice before leaving I feel like escaping, I don't even want a drink nor to feel that way, I just want to escape the pain. Sleeping next to and raising kids with someone you love that spends every waking moment either with, snapchatting, texting, calling and even talking about her friend is HARD. When we do have time alone she's talking about him too, like playing with our kids and it's ""Chris said oldest daughter is built like a linebacker"" ""Chris is going to make me a table but I will have to go over there alone to get it"" etc. And I know I deserve it, these are my consequences but I need help getting rid of this insecurity, so far i've done alright. I walk away and read or cry so no one else has to hear it but, are there any other techniques to deal with this?

After being sober for more than two years I got my answer.  I lost my job, developed physical problems, my diabetic father lost a leg, and someone I loved left me for another - and all of this happened during a two-week period.  Reality crashed in, yet A.A. was there to support, comfort, and strengthen me.  The principles I had learned during my early days of sobriety became a mainstay of my life, for not only did I come through, but I never stopped being able to help newcomers.

***************

I spend a great deal of time passing on what I learned to others who want and need it badly. I do it for four reasons:

1. Sense of duty. 

2. It is a pleasure. 

3. Because in so doing I am paying my debt to the man who took time to pass it on to me. 

4. Because every time I do it I take out a little more insurance for myself against a possible slip.

**************

I've been reading a lot on this sub from old timers who bail on meetings.  Too much trouble.  Too much ""chaos.""  Got better this to do.  ""Get on with your life,"" one wrote.

Here's a quote from ""Drop the Rock"":

*****************

""Don D. went to an AA meeting one evening. He frowned when a member mispronounced a few words while reading ‚ÄúHow It Works.‚Äù He felt appalled when another member stood up and said he was an alcoholic and an addict. Another person talked too long. As he slipped out the door immediately after the meeting, Don D. muttered, 'That was terrible. I should have stayed home.'""

""Bob M. went to a meeting one evening. His head was bowed as he listened to the ‚ÄúPreamble‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow It Works.‚Äù His eyes moistened as he listened intently to a member tell his story. He was grateful for being able to attend this meeting. After cleanup and a little socializing, he paused, and as he locked the meeting room door, his thoughts were, ‚ÄúThank God for such a beautiful fellowship.‚Äù 

""Both AA members were at the same meeting. Each found what he was looking for.""

*******************************

Be the change you want to see in the world.  Don't like the meetings?  Go to a business meeting and voice your concerns..  If that doesn't work,, start a new one.  But don't be that guy (or girl) who rolls into AA, gets what s/he needs, and rolls out.  Even if you can do it without risk of relapse, don't do it.  Don't be that guy.

Do you believe. or are you willing to believe, in a power greater than you who can solve your problem?  Are you willing to go to any lengths?  But I ask one more too:  Before we go on in these steps, do you promise (PROMISE) that if I can help you find a lasting solution to your problem. that you will help others, exactly as I am helping you -- using these steps and this book?  Do you promise me that?  I've never had anyone refuse.  But if I did, I wouldn't take the steps with him.  Because (I say to them) I'm not doing this to help you.  I'm doing it to help the guys your sponsee's sponsees are going to help.

There was a guy in there, I really tried to be friendly with him but he always seemed to have this attitude like he was too good to be conversing with myself and some of the others who had really lost a lot from our alcoholism.  This was his first time in detox and treatment, I had shared with him that my story was different.. I had been to detox quite a few times and this was my second time in rehab.   He always sort of seemed to look down on me for that, maybe that was just me assuming I knew what people are thinking of me.  That's a major character defect of mine, thinking people dislike me or worrying about being disliked.  Either way, we didn't exactly bond in there despite being roommates.  I would try and start conversations with him and he never seemed interested in really talking to me.  It is what it is.

&#x200B;

This was a short inpatient stay, designed for only 3-4 weeks.  They get you in the door like that so that once you're there for what you think is going to be a short stay, then they try and get you into aftercare (Partial hospitalization, IOP, and sober living).   Having already gone to rehab for a month and experienced the ""I got this, i'm cured im sober now I wont drink again"" mental mindfuck your brain plays on you.. this time I was willing to do what was suggested of me.  I had already learned the hard way if I just go back to what I was doing before and don't make changes, i will drink again.  I really tried to share my experience with other people in there, tried to stress that sober living was important.  Either way, I went on with the aftercare and sober living, the last thing I said to this guy was "" you gonna go to PHP or sober living?"".  His words were "" No man, I have a wife to get back to.  I've got this"".

&#x200B;

This dude was really successful.  He hadn't lost his family, job, and everything to the drink like I had.  He didn't drink daily for a decade like I did.  He seemed for the most part, to drink very heavy and go on these sprees periodically, then sober up.  This spree that landed him in treatment went on for quite a bit, and he seeked help for it.  He had a great job, a family, a lot going on for him.   I told him that I really hoped to see him around AA meetings.  He assured me he would go,

&#x200B;

Well.  Months passed, I didn't ever see him at any meetings around town.  It's pretty much a fact that when you go to rehab some of the people in there are going to die from this thing, but I never thought it would be him.  Surely one of the heroin addicts or the older drunks who's body was already shutting down.  Hell, I would have thought myself would be more likely to be the victim. 

&#x200B;

This guy lost his father last month and started drinking again.  He fell down last week hit his head while drunk and died.  The guy that thought he surely had this thing under control.  The guy that didn't think his problem was severe enough to do what was suggested of him, the guy that thought he  wasn't as bad as everyone else.  The person in there with perhaps the most potential to be really successful.  It's sad.   Now his family has to deal with two deaths in like the span of a month

'... You can... make A.A. itself your 'higher power'.  Here's a very large group of people who have solved their alcohol problem... many members... have crossed the threshold just this way... their faith broadened and deepened... transformed, they came to believe in a Higher Power...'

No one was greater than I, at least in my eyes, when I was drinking.  Nevertheless, I couldn't smile at myself in the mirror, so I came to A.A. where, with others, I heard talk of a Higher Power.  I couldn't accept the concept of a Higher Power because I believed God was cruel and unloving.  In desperation I chose a table, a tree, then my A.A. group, as my Higher Power.  Time passed, my life improved, and I began to wonder about this Higher Power.  Gradually, with patience, humility and a lot of questions, I came to believe in God.  Now my relationship with my Higher Power gives me the strength to live a happy, sober life.

We found that God does not make too hard terms with those who seek Him.  To us, the Realm of Spirit is broad, roomy, all inclusive; never exclusive or forbidding to those who earnestly seek.  It is open, we believe, to all men.


- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 46


Open-mindedness to concepts of a Higher Power can open doors to the spirit.  Often I find the human spirit in various dogmas and faiths.  I can be spiritual in the sharing of myself.  The sharing of self joins me to the human race and brings me closer to God, as I understand Him.

Today is one year sober. I've been a heavy drinker since I was very young, maybe before I was a teen. It was encouraged in my home, through the abuses at least I always slept. I'm 30 this year, and this was hands down the biggest gift I ever could've given myself. I had been faithfully drinking every day for maybe 18 years.

In the last 365 days, there have been a lot of tests and stress. I had cravings almost every minute at the beginning, I never went to any meetings (shame). I struggled hard for a while, I worked at a grocery store that sold alcohol, most of the time i was alone so i might have been able to get away with it. I had to fight through the initial detox which I thought was going to kill me. Rupturing something in my throat dryheaving, choking on my own blood as I tried to force breath into my lungs between the convulsions. The sheer panic and terror, fighting through the lies i already tried setting up to justify a trip to the store. . .I promise I will never put myself, or my absolutely terrified and shaken husband through that ever again.

But for every ""bad"" I encountered, I had a hundred tiny victories that seem so small, but carried so much weight through this year. My teeth are better. I was able to cut roughly 2,000 calories from my diet daily from cutting alcohol alone, that scared me the most because a normal person consumes 2k cals in order to live, not kill themselves. I lost over 60lbs, just working on getting back in shape. My kids are excited to see me. Work trusts me. My husband and my relationship is still a little rocky, but at least now I have the patience to sit down with him and figure out a solution. I can sleep again. My balance is better. I'm working through the trauma instead of sedating myself in order to replay it all over in my head every night. My face isn't swollen anymore. My skin is clear. My hair and nails are healthy and actually growing. My skin doesn't smell like I've been sweating whisky all day.

The biggest takeaway, from all of this? I don't absolutely hate myself. I like my life, a lot of times I feel like I love it for real. It seems so simple, but I just chose not to drink one day, for one day. The next day, I chose the same thing. Didn't have to be forever, didn't have to make any promises, didn't have to stick with a plan-- just don't buy liquor for one day. One day turns into day one, and eventually one year.

Will I be sober for the rest of my life? Probably, but I'm not putting that kind of pressure on myself. I can hardly keep promises to fold laundry the same day it's run. I chose not to drink yesterday, and that was nice. I'm going to continue that feeling on to today, and choose not to drink.

A lot of what you guys have said here have helped a lot more than you could ever really know. The stories of relapse and regret, ""pick your hard"". . .who knew spending so much time around strong people would lead to some of it rubbing off. I'm proud of me today, and I'm proud of you (whether its been 40 years or 4 hours since your last drink).

A recent death in the family has scared the shit out of me and given me a kick on the ass to actually make amends with family members. Life is short and I need to get over myself. However, my Dad is also an addict. He had emotionally abused and manipulated me and my Mom for as long as I can remember. 

I love him and as much as I don‚Äôt want to admit this, I pity him and feel terribly for him. He was abused as a child and I see his flaws in me, as expected. He‚Äôs a broken man and a flawed man, just like the rest of us. I understand that he‚Äôs spiritually sick and that I need to get this over with, but my inner child is so wounded and the wounds are fresh.

I knew this would be the hardest amends to do, but as much as my higher self knows that this needs to happen- I was at fault in a lot of our relationship when I was an ACTIVE alcoholic and addict and then a source of toxicity in early sobriety- I just feel hurt still and not ready.

My younger brother would physically assault my mother and father as a teenager, (I needed to call the cops more than any kid should ever have to) and on more than one occasions he made me truly feel like he would break my face. I had to see/prevent my moms suicide attempt after finding a letter where she blamed me, my brother and my dad. 

When we grew up and I rented from him, he would consistently threaten to shoot my dog (he is a hunter and very proud of his guns). He could say it in front of my parents and they would take his side. My parents manipulated me into going to conversion therapy and when that didn‚Äôt work, they disinherited me so I stopped talking to them. 

Through the whole time, as an adult and as a drunk, I obviously said and did some pretty irritating and embarrassing things to my brother. At the end of our contact I compared him (he was separated not divorced and immediately started seeing another woman he had an emotional affair with and my parents were supportive of this) to myself and asked my parents how his cheating/divorce were any different than my homosexuality in the Bible. When his (Christian) employers began to harass him for initiating a divorce, I drunkenly worded an email to his employers in his defense and totally humiliated him. 

I just contacted him for the first time since I stopped talking to our parents and owned up to him. He accepted my apology and spoke his view in detail that he felt that himself and my parents had given me every opportunity and chance and that I ‚Äúnever ceased to shit on people who tried to help me the most.‚Äù

I came away from that conversation

a) gracefully not bringing up his wrongs to me

b) thinking I was fucking crazy

I know this isn‚Äôt about me and I need to keep my side of the street clean but I‚Äôve been gaslit beyond belief and this feels like deja vu all over again. How do I move past this?",13,0

This brought me to the good healthy realization that there were plenty of situations left in the world over which I had no personal power - that if I was so ready to admit that to be the case with alcohol, so I must make the same admission with respect to much else.  I would have to be still and know that He, not I, was God.

I am learning to practice acceptance in all circumstances of my life, so that I may enjoy peace of mind.  At one time life was a constant battle because I felt I had to go through each day fighting myself, and everyone else.  Eventually, this became a losing battle.  I ended up getting drunk and crying over my misery.  When I began to let go and let God take over my life I began to have peace of mind.  Today, I am free.  I do not have to fight anybody or anything anymore.

But does trust require that we be blind to other people's motives or, indeed, to our own?  Not at all; this would be folly.  Most certainly, we should assess the capacity for harm as well as the capability for good in every person that we would trust.  Such a private inventory can reveal the degree of confidence we should extend in any given situation.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 144

I am not a victim of others, but rather a victim of my expectations, choices and dishonesty.  When I expect others to be what I want them to be and not who they are, when they fail to meet my expectations, I am hurt.  When my choices are based on self-centeredness, I find I am lonely and distrustful.  I gain confidence in myself, however, when I practice honesty in all my affairs.  When I search my motives and am honest and trusting, I am aware of the capacity for harm in situations and can avoid those that are harmful.

It really is. I am 28, but within the last couple years hangovers have been terrible to me and leave me with crippling anxiety for 2 days at least. Not just anxiety, but shame, regret, and feeling sick. However, every time I am presented with an opportunity to drink after I've recovered, I get the feeling of ""FOMO"", or ""fear of missing out"". I feel like I'll miss out on a fun time with my friends or family, or I'll miss out on a summers day of day drinking that so many people WISH they had the time to do! The alcoholic in me will make up any excuse to drink.

So, my newest strategy is really trying to remind myself of all the things I am ***gaining*** due to sobriety and why it's so much better than a belly full of booze and a brain full of regret. I'm trying to reverse it and think of all the things I'll miss out on if I ***do*** drink. I'll miss out on a day full of productive energy. I'll miss out on bettering my health. I'll miss out on preparing properly for school for my dream career that I'm just so close to achieving. By not drinking, I am gaining those things back and gaining my control back.

A year and I'm still in the same place.

Before I drank my wife and I bought a house, we had children, we had friends and family around all the time. Those few early years were amazing. Now 6 years after I discovered I liked whiskey on ice, I drink four nights a week, see no one unless I  work with them (except a couple guys that are always down to get drunk) The home we bought for our family is in a serious state of disrepair.

My older siblings are both heavy pot smokers and have been since I can remember. I know they are addicts.

I've binge drank to the point that I did things I later regretted. Drinking alcohol to either loosen up or relax felt like it was becoming a need. There are days that I don't drink, but as soon as I can buy some to keep with me, I go for it. 

Most of the time I go out with my buds I *need* to have some alcohol (in italics because I know I don't really need it, but it really feels like I do). For some reason I feel like it helps to enjoy the moment more. When I get home, I realize it really didn't: I could be sober and just enjoy everything. I could be sober and not have to worry about the things I said or did. I could be sober and not forget certain things in the conversation.

I am not sure how strong my resolve is, to be honest. I feel like I have an addictive personality (although some think that's not really a thing). Yesterday I had three drinks, but this morning as I woke up I felt like wanting to just put a stop on it. Yes, it hasn't affected my work or anything, but I have lost people in my life in the past because of it. So today I want to till the soil and stop drinking.

Just saying that out loud, wow, that was something. Freeing, scary and far less shameful than I have ever thought it may be. The group I was with was so incredibly supportive. 

I've always been of this mindset that because I drank fancy double IPAs from small craft brewers instead of a $2 pounder or two on my way home from work I didn't have a problem. I'm not what I considered to be a stereotypical alcoholic. I didn't have to have a drink the moment I got up. I've been able to hold a well paying job that I am respected at. A fella at my meeting last night said something that truly resonated with me. He said ""from jail to Yale, that's what AA is"". And while none of us are the exact same person, we are in this boat and have a problem with alcohol that has made our lives difficult and unmanageable.  Drinking five or six 8.5% IPAs doesn't change that fact and in more ways than one has clouded my judgement. Its not healthy and completely delusional of me to have felt that way for so long. 

I am about to head out the door to my second meeting. I know this is one day at a time, but I look forward to my third meeting, my fourth meeting, and so on.

Just wanted to say I appreciate all the others in AA out there.",39,0

2149,Ranting of an alcoholic just picked up my 17 year chip,36,o9zdcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/o9zdcg/ranting_of_an_alcoholic_just_picked_up_my_17_year/,10,1624934742.0,"For give me, I may be all over the place with this. I‚Äôm a terrible writer. 

I just picked up my 17 year chip last sat and wanted to get real about life and it‚Äôs difficulty. Because of the textbook of Alcoholics Anonymous I have been given a design for living. An ability to live life successfully, that is being content and maintain piece of mind even with life‚Äôs failures and trials. Slips and relapse is always a possibility if I stop doing what I need to but the immediate danger for me is lapse into selfishness or instant gratification. I try to always do the next right thing one thing at a time and sometimes i don‚Äôt want to. When don‚Äôt I suffer the consequences. If I do then I reap the rewards. Problem is if I don‚Äôt my family also suffers the consequences. 

This is my struggle currently. I have been VERY blessed. My wife and I met in AA, both under a year sober. We are both active in recovery, I won‚Äôt go into much detail here as as that could be a topic in itself. She will have 17 years in November. We have been together for more than 16y and married for 11y next month. We have 4 wonderful children 8y, 4y, 3y and 1y. My wife has a promising career in healthcare administration and has gone back to school full time as well to get a masters in public health. I have a career in horticulture and do very well for that field. I say this not to brag but as background. The program has given us these things. I have no idea how to be husband, father, employee or employer.  God has put opportunities and responsibilities in front of me and like I said I try to the next right thing, One thing at a time and gradually I have been successful. We have a lot to lose if we slip into old behavior or mind set. 

I‚Äôm overwhelmed. I‚Äôll get through it but 4 small kids is a lot to handle. Especially with 2 full time jobs and full time school. I‚Äôm as supporting as possible with her school (she went back at my insistence) I can do that. But I still want ‚Äúme time‚Äù (woodworking or riding my motorcycle). Keeping the house clean is a constant battle. Laundry is the never ending story. I HATE bedtime! As of right now I have put them back to bed 3 times. We are good parents and have lots of support from family. Our kids are healthy, mostly well behaved and very happy. Again we are blessed I should not complain, things could be worse, but I‚Äôm tired. I want to be selfish and have my fun. I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt get to have fun I have plenty this just a rant, I am after all an alcoholic and have that obsessiveness when it comes to things I enjoy. 

The kick to the pants we got today is my wife has 2  Non-malignant brain tumors. Thankfully it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúget your affairs in order‚Äù kind of prognosis but FUCK I‚Äôm scared. What do I do? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm at my limits. How can I be any more supportive? I must be. God will make it possible. 

I‚Äôm 17 years sober and have never had shit figured out. Am scared often. I almost always overwhelmed. But I am consistently happy. God has replaced calamity with serenity (most of the time). When I sobered up I was a 22 year old high school dropout, homeless, suffering yellow skin and eyes from drinking, wishing for death because I was miserable. The steps, sponsorship, a solid recovery group, and my Higher Power have gotten me through a lot. I lost my father 3 years ago during that period we had a health scare with our 3rd child. I‚Äôve lost a good job and had a very close brush with divorce. All the while God has given me the strength to‚Ä¶ do the next right thing. I just wish I was standing on the other side of this already. I don‚Äôt want to find the strength. I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúget through it‚Äù I want to BE through it. Maybe I should take a page from Bill‚Äôs story ‚Äúwork with another alcoholic would always save the day‚Äù

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs my rant. there could be more but I will end it here with this, my life is better than I deserve, not perfect, but right where He would have me be. I will keep trudging the road to happy destiny, I look forward to meeting more of you along the way. 




And with that I‚Äôll pass",36,0

Having learned to live so happily, we'd show everyone else how... Yes, we of A.A. did dream those dreams.  How natural that was, since most alcoholics are bankrupt idealists... So why shouldn't we share our way of life with everyone?

The great discovery of sobriety led me to feel the need to spread the 'good news' to the world around me.  The grandiose thoughts of my drinking days returned.  Later, I learned that concentrating on my own recovery was a full-time process.  As I became a sober citizen in this world, I observed a rippling effect which, without any conscious effort on my part, reached any 'related facility or outside enterprise,' without diverting me from my primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

2151,Does the AA 12-Step Method Work?,34,oaciyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/oaciyo/does_the_aa_12step_method_work/,66,1624986321.0,"See if you think so. Think of it . . . a mental obsession with carbohydrates like sugar or alcohol, where one cannot stop even though they want and need to stop . . . indicates what is seen as an ‚Äòaddiction‚Äô.

Any substance or behavior used beyond its natural purpose to make a person feel better than they deserve to feel due to the underlying resentment-based pain of conscience is an abuse. And sugar is a big one. It‚Äôs right up there with sex, booze, or drugs like nicotine, cocaine, or Xanax. It might be porn, approval-seeking, or gossip.

There's an endless list of dopaminergic or analgesic activities and products that become subject to abuse to anyone burdened with the need. But whichever is abused, the individual automatically loses control as he becomes fixated with obtaining the relief supplied. That resultant unmanageable state is seen as addiction.

It‚Äôs simple to do too. It‚Äôs SO simple, in fact, that hardly anyone will do it. And yet the solution is the same for *all* addictions. Get to the source. Stop hating, get free of anger, see and accept the natural combination of shame and remorse for previously unrecognized resentments . . . *then the need for relief immediately and spontaneously falls away. POOF! Gone.*

This is why Alcoholics Anonymous has been so successful.  The 12-Steps go STRAIGHT for the resentments. That is because when these are discovered and faced, the need dissolves, and the obsession just leaves. The once-addicted individual experiences full recovery. No relapse and no struggle as long as he keeps his anger-free condition through prayer and meditation, *which is Step 11.*

I encourage anyone struggling with just going to meetings and counseling or religions and DIY approaches but still suffering from anxiety, obsessive thinking, and misery to give the 12 Step spiritual awakening approach a fair go. It's fast, under 30 days when done by the book, and it's effective too.",34,0

My son is 19, and has abused alcohol and drugs since he was 15 or so.  To cut a very long story short, he's found himself in rehab at 16 for Xanax, sold weed, associated with the wrong crowd, and has a pending DUI.  Without getting into too much, he's had liquor bottles, beer cans etc stuffed in his room and car, shown up late at night drunk/high several times.  He's lost a job because of it.  Most recently he's totaled his car into a tree, broke his leg and suffered a concussion.  He's still recovering from that.  This brings us to last night.

Last night he seemingly got tired of the bad influence friends he had, got in a fist fight with one of them and decided to drop them all.  He came home with thoughts of finding groups of people that like to shoot pool (he does like billiards), finding better groups in church and, in his words, going to AA and being with people on his own path.  I think he finally realized that being drunk in public and fighting over McDonalds food is not where he wants to be.  He definitely sounded more resolute than he ever has about his situation.

I'm his dad, and I would do anything for him, especially if he is trying to help himself.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I drink occasionally, and sometimes regret it in the morning due to a stomach ache, sometimes not.  I think this would make me an unpopular person in an AA meeting.

It really nailed down, for me, how I can keep on rolling downhill if I go back out. Downhill to where all my ""yets"" live. Definitely going to share it with my other young sober people. 

*The person who shared said that alcoholism is like a bell-curve. When you start drinking it's fun, new, and exciting. It's like going up to the top of a roller coaster. You don't always know what drinking will bring, but it's in a good way. You're 'finding yourself'. You're in touch with a side of you you've always looked for, but were never able to find. You want to keep finding.* 

*You're  almost to the top of the curve, but you don't know it. Not yet. You've blacked out a couple of times, passed out in places you weren't sure how you arrived at, but you're still safe. Nothing bad has happened. It's a little embarrassing, but aren't mistakes made when you drink?*

*You've reached the top of the curve. Alcohol is your best friend. You've never felt more like yourself than in this moment.* 

*Then the curve starts to slope downhill. And the first bad thing happens. What is this consequence? What is this shame that you feel? But it's not like I've lost a job or gotten a DUI. It's just a fluke.* 

*The curve continues downward and the flukes start happening more and more frequently until it's every time you drink. You have a moment of clarity and decide to get off this rollercoaster. Someone explains how you can choose to get back on and ride it to the bottom if you wish, but nothing good waits there. The bell curve never goes back up once you're on the other side.*

NA beer was once a joke, but it has been embraced in recent years by craft breweries and is an entirely different product than the dusty bottle of O'Douls in the corner of the liquor cabinet. I find that a well-made non-alcoholic IPA or lager (particularly with a meal or after a workout) brings me quite a bit of joy without any of the negative aspects that come along with drinking alcohol.

I've heard people put NA beer down however and even some who say that because it contains up to 0.5% alcohol by volume, it ""isn't sober."" I'm curious as to whether or not these people also avoid ripe oranges and store-bought bread, both of which surpass NA beer ABVs of 0.5% and can even range as high as 1.9%.

There also seems to be some sort of ""badge of honor"" mentality where folks clarify over and over again that they did NOT drink for the taste; they drank for the effects. As if there is a mutually exclusive line where someone who defaults to an urge to blot out and escape can't also share a taste and interest in fermented foods and beverages; the latter must not be a ""real"" alcoholic because they know about grape varietals and don't drink Colt 45 all day.

It would seem to me that the logic behind NA being a bad idea presumes that the person in question has a desire to resume drinking alcohol and is ""white knuckling"" to maintain sobriety for whatever reason or reasons they have to not drink.  

I have never once had an urge to throw away my sobriety while drinking a de-alc'd beer; alcohol has zero appeal to me after the work I've done and I can't imagine why I would ever want to go back to the hell that was my life before I stopped drinking.",13,0

It was the scariest moment and I had to call my boyfriend to come bring me more alcohol from the house because I didn‚Äôt have much in my car. I sat with him in the parking lot for about an hour sobbing hysterically in his arms and the very next day I started my prescription for gabapentin. I was very hesitant at first considering I‚Äôve heard horror stories about detoxing but it has been relatively painless besides really thick brain fog and random panic. Friday night was my first shift bartending sober in my entire life. It was awkward, I was over-thinking, I forgot how to make drinks somehow which doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me, it was the most frustrating and uncomfortable night of my life but I made it through.

When I was out there hurting and causing hurt, I didn't know I was the asshole. I was doing the best I could and still hurting people. I try to remember that when other people bother me, when other alcoholics in the program say or do hurtful things, condescend or lecture, no matter how much time they have. Especially in AA, since we come here admitting defeat, identifying as a fellow sufferer. Whether we have 30 days or 30 years, ""we have not recovered from alcoholism. What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent upon the maintenance of our spiritual condition.""  

It was good practice in the rooms, learning that if I judge a meeting or fellow alcoholic then the only thing I'm doing is cutting myself off from the program and making myself uncomfortable, and I don't like self imposed discomfort. Once I began to learn to love each alcoholic right where they are, I took that spirit out into the world, looking at anyone who bothered me as just another flawed human being, like myself, ""doing the best they can with the experience they have."" I learned to look at my past self with love, as this rude lil struggling asshole doing the best he can. When someone cuts me off on the road, I try to imagine my past self driving that car. Punishment only pushed me further into self-centeredness, so I try not to box him in anymore, I just let him through. People tolerated me in the rooms, and loved me enough to help me understand this new way of living. The world tolerated me and now I try to tolerate the world, instead focusing on myself, my motivations, my response, my choices of what to do with my life, my heart, my internal peace, and where to place myself.  

One friend used to say, ""these motherfuckers keep taking my peace away,"" and my sponsor would respond, ""no one is taking your peace away. You're the one giving it away.""

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 75

Either the A.A. way of life becomes one of joy or I return to the darkness and despair of alcoholism.  Joy comes to me when my attitude concerning God and humility turns to one of desire rather than of burden.  The darkness in my life changes to radiant light when I arrive at the realization that being truthful and honest in dealing with my inventory results in my life being filled with serenity, freedom, and joy.  Trust in my Higher Power deepens, and the flush of gratitude spreads through my being.  I am convinced that being humble is being truthful and honest in dealing with myself and God.  It is then that humility is something I 'really want,' rather than being 'something I must have.'

Our marriage in the last six months has completely spiraled. At the end of March I discovered his infidelity. I‚Äôve been a constant rollercoaster of emotions since. Staying or leaving. 

Then last week I found beer in his pick up. And he‚Äôs back to chewing gum. Reminiscent of the early days in trying to hide his drinking. I purposely didn‚Äôt ask or say anything, giving him an opportunity to fess up. What was I thinking?! Because, of course he didn‚Äôt. 

It‚Äôs been‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶13 years since my days of al-anon. And recovering is a constant daily battle. I‚Äôve always supported him. And I don‚Äôt drink myself.

For without some degree of humility, no alcoholic can stay sober at all... Without it, they cannot live to much useful purpose, or, in adversity, be able to summon the faith that can meet any emergency.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 70

Why do I balk at the word 'humility'?  I am not humbling myself toward other people, but toward God, as I understand Him.  Humility means 'to show submissive respect,' and by being humble I realize I am not the center of the universe.  When I was drinking, I was consumed by pride and self-centeredness.  I felt the entire world revolved around me, that I was master of my destiny.  Humility enables me to depend more on God to help me overcome obstacles, to help me with my own imperfections, so that I may grow spiritually.  I must solve more difficult problems to increase my proficiency and, as I encounter life's stumbling blocks, I must learn to overcome them through God's help.  Daily communion with God demonstrates my humility and provides me with the realization that an entity more powerful than I is willing to help me if I cease trying to play God myself.

Why I don‚Äôt drink - Anonymous

""How come you don't drink anymore?"" a renewed acquaintance from long ago asked the other day.

""Anymore than who?, I asked.

""I mean any longer. How come you don't drink anything these days?""

""Drink? I drink...coffee, milk, juice, tea, soda pop, water...""

""I mean drink"" he said. "" you know, booze.""

""Oh, booze, No I don't drink booze any more, you're right,"" I said, I couldn't' trust it anymore. It turned on me. Once my friend, it became my enemy.""

""Maybe you got a bad batch."" he said.

""No the sauce is the same. I changed. Because I have this illness of alcoholism, my tolerance weakened. Alcoholism doesn't come in bottles, it comes in people.""

""Sounds pretty confusing"" the fellow said

""You think you're confused,"" I said, ""You should have seen me. I drank for happiness and became unhappy... I drank for joy and became miserable... I drank to be outgoing and became self centered... I drank for sociability and became argumentative and lonely‚Ä¶ I drank for sophistication and became crude and obnoxious...I drank for friendship and made enemies... I drank to soften sorrow and wallowed in self pity... I drank for sleep and wakened without rest‚Ä¶ I drank for strength and felt weak‚Ä¶ I drank medicinally and got sick‚Ä¶ I drank because I thought my job called for it and I lost my job‚Ä¶ I drank for relaxation and got the shakes‚Ä¶ I drank for confidence and became uncertain‚Ä¶ I drank for courage and became afraid... I drank for assurance and became doubtful... I drank to stimulate thought and blacked out... I drank to make conversation and it tied my tongue... I drank for warmth and lost my cool‚Ä¶ I drank for coolness and lost my warmth... I drank to feel heaven and came to know hell‚Ä¶ I drank to forget and became haunted‚Ä¶ I drank for freedom and became a slave... I drank to erase problems and saw them multiply... I drank to cope with life and invited death... or worse... I drank because I had the right and everything turned out wrong‚Ä¶‚Äù

""Gosh!"" My friend exclaimed, ""That must have taken a bunch of booze to get you in that shape.‚Äù

""Just one"" I told him, ""The first one. For me one is too many, and a thousand is not enough.""

""So that is why you don't drink anymore...?‚Äù

&#x200B;

This is the longest stretch of sobriety I have put together.  In January of last year I got sober for around 40 days, and then in August I got sober for 90 days.  The relapse after 90 days of sobriety brought me to a very low bottom where I wound up in the psych ward diagnosed with covid 19 after threatening suicide so I could get a medical detox I couldn't afford.  After being released from the hospital and quarantining myself for 10 days, on New Years Eve I drank again.  Continued to drink for the next 12 days seeing no way out.  I managed to get health insurance from government benefits and will some financial help from my family I went into rehab for the second time of my life.  Only this time I was truely desperate and willing to do the things suggested of me.

Few beer here, few beer there. Nothing problematic. About a year and a half ago, work was getting super stressful and thats when I started drinking daily. My depression was through the roof, anxiety was high, had my first ever panic attack. It was hell, so I started drinking to try and calm down. Few months in, I finally quit that job. But Covid was at an all time high, I couldnt find a new job, my wife and I started getting fucked up every night because why not. Two months in to being wasted every night, I finaly found a job. The first bit was stressful trying to adjust to a new shop, continued drinking. After I got accustomed, my coworkers found out I drank like a fish so we just kept drinking. Spent countless nights at work late just taking shots of shine and rum or just a few beer. It wasnt until about last Christmas that wife pointed out my problem and that was only because my skin was starting to turn yellow(?) and she was worried. We slowed down a bit. Limited ourselves to $50 each a month. So of course I stsrted buying the cheapest of cheap booze. The less $$$ and higher percentage was my go too. I now can buy an 8pack of 7% for under $10CAD. So this went on for a bit, I'd maybe go a total of a week per month without drinking. A few months ago we hit a rough patch we were flat broke and that was the longest time I spent sober, it was maybe 3weeks, get paid, grab booze, then wait for payday again. Well this is the kicker, we went camping this weekend, my wife, our two kids and I. I remember the most of the weekend. But I was pretty shitted for the most part. As I write this I'm drinking the last beer in my fridge. I want this to be my last beer. Ive said this before and its never worked. But I honestly want this to be last beer. Its been about a year and half of me being plastered 24/7 and I need it to stop.",16,0

As long as we placed self-reliance first, a genuine reliance upon a Higher Power was out of the question.  That basic ingredient of all humility, a desire to seek and do God's will, was missing.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 72

When I first came to A.A., I wanted to find some of the elusive quality called humility.  I didn't realize I was looking for humility because I thought it would help me get what I wanted, and that I would do anything for others if I thought God would somehow reward me for it.  I try to remember now that the people I meet in the course of my day are as close to God as I am ever going to get while on this earth.  I need to pray for knowledge of God's will today, and see how my experience with hope and pain can help other people; if I can do that, I don't need to search for humility, it has found me.

My boyfriend of 3 years is an alcoholic, and it‚Äôs beginning to take a real toll on me. He doesn‚Äôt drink every day anymore, but when he does drink it is in excess and he becomes very cruel and obnoxious. 
We have been sharing an apartment for just under a year now, and he has recently returned to work due to covid-19 lockdown restrictions lifting where we live. As a result of this, his drinking has picked back up again and he has begun to come home later and later (3-5am) and verbally abusing me after his shift ends. 
I don‚Äôt have the means to find another place to live right now. Things were really good for a while but he seems to be worse than ever now. Although he mostly yells and berates me, and engages in generally dangerous and irresponsible behaviour when drunk, he has recently started getting physical with me as well. He has not hit or harmed me but I worry that the pushing, personal space invasion and general disrespect might escalate to more violent behaviour. 
My friends and family don‚Äôt really know the extent of this, and I‚Äôm not comfortable telling them yet.  I‚Äôm feeling trapped and anxious. I love him but I‚Äôm starting to see a pattern in his behaviour and its getting hard to accept his apologies the morning after.",19,0

She looked visibly a little unsure because the timing was just too synchronistic, but continued ""In my journey I have witnessed absolutely nothing that would lead me to believe there is a higher power...""  this time there was loud thunder clap and the lights went off for about two seconds, and she ran out of the room with her hands on her head, and im pretty sure she left.

So, i get him wanting space and being gone but its been days. He was finally home and we talked this morning about my feelings, him being gone, how its effecting our kid, (we are exes that still together), how i want to just want to move forward and work on this friendship and how he needs to stop leaving bc our daughter is getting mad about it. Seemed like a good talk. He even offered to go to Fiesta for the day. I said yes. He goes to work and mentioned our kid coming to his work for a few hrs so i can breathe and have me time. That lasted 3 hours. I was going to get her it by 6pm, but he ended up getting off early and needing to go back in a few hrs to close. Okay cool we hung out and talked. Ate dinner with our kid. I got an email telling me i had to go into to work.

So because i have to go to work meant him going out again after work and not coming home until tomorrow. And from his mouth you guys will be asleep anyways. Fucking asshole. I told him he was going to continue to do this and boom he does. Yeah i got pissed off. Texted him. I fucking doubt he is even going to work.

Yes i fucked up. But i got right back up on my own this week. And he is just using it to be gone all the fucking time. Before he left i said that it didnt last long and it was nice to hang out.

Due to my own negligence in working the program, I relapsed right when everything was getting shut down in March 2020. I was devastated that I fell off again after 6 stints in treatment, so I just gave up. I drank away my job, my spouse, my house, my truck, my scholarship, and my finances over the next 9 months. I was ready to die, feeling doomed to a life of substance abuse. Self isolation increased to the maximum, to the point where I was actively trying to kill myself with alcohol and drugs. With that in mind, I acted like that towards other people too, at times intentionally burning bridges professionally and personally, destroying my reputation and alienating most people that knew me. I just didn't care anymore, because I didn't think I'd be around to live with the repercussions of my ridiculous behavior.

The thing is, at some point this past Spring after another DUI and another shitty job lost, I chose life. I checked myself into an inpatient treatment center and later moved into a halfway house, and am giving the program an honest try and being successful with it thus far. What I am having trouble with now is that I am constantly haunted by reminders of the things I did while drinking and using like I was, relationships I irreparably damaged, lies I told, etc., that at times I honestly think it would be easier to change my name, move far away, and start completely over. I can't imagine making some of these amends to these people. I feel so socially stunted at this point because I can't seem to forgive myself for my behavior before, which is making me very hesitant to form new sober relationships.

I've just opened a bar and restaurant.
I am drinking whatever I want from morning to night. I drink to take away stress, to remove anxiety, to put me into ""showbiz"" mode and dazzle customers.
I am 'High Functioning'.
My musical and literary hero's all drank, which is how I justify it.
I hate the person I've become and I have just confided in my wife to try to fix this.
She told me she's disappointed in me.

Help me Reddit please x

EDIT:
Today I haven't had a single drink.
We had a guiness tap installed and the engineer poured the perfect pint, I got my chef to test it.
Every bottle I passed took everything to not sup.
I was scared to go in the cellar as that was one of my secret spots. I went down there and held some of the bottles, just to see if I could.
It was a hard day but that's day 1 done.
Thank you all for the kind words and support.",12,0

I don't even know how to introduce myself (Hi, I'm irrelevantzillennial and I'm an ____.)

However my therapist has asked me to attend a meeting every day of the week, and I'm afraid that if I don't she'll stop seeing me. She is an expert in what I am diagnosed with and I don't want to lose her help. 

I drink a very low volume of alcohol for an alcoholic. The problem is that I take several sedating psychiatric medications, including gabapentin which i take multiple times a day so it's literally always in my system. I have severe PTSD and these medications are necessary and none of them are narcotics, but they lower my alcohol tolerance to almost nothing. I get messy drunk off of what would barely give even normal drinkers a buzz. Professionals and friends have told me it can be fatal to drink with how much and the types of medications I take, but I can't stop. 

I also get stupid when I drink and will mix extra meds with my alcohol to make the feeling of intoxication stronger. Again, not narcotics. I am the dumbest addict ever because I'm out here mixing antipsychotics with booze to black out, but it's what I have available so I don't have to go looking for it elsewhere, and it works.

I also have a dissociative disorder and so I have a lot of memory and personality disturbances when I drink. Alcohol exacerbates the symptoms of this disorder because it lowers my inhibitions to a point where I can't mask as effectively. 

I am a nightmare to drink with, as you can imagine, so I always drink alone. When I had a car, I never hesitated to drive drunk. I am covered in self injury scars, many from when I've been drunk. 

I also abused Benadryl for a LONG time, which has to be the most embarrassing ""drug"" to tell people you have abused. 

I have to go to these meetings or I might lose my therapist, who *clearly* I need to keep seeing. How do I parse all of this out so I don't look like an idiot? When I look at my habits clearly, which is hard to do and I have spent years trying to avoid, I know I have a problem of some kind, and I definitely know I can't stop drinking on my own, because I keep trying and relapsing and trying and relapsing. But I'm scared and ashamed to share any details about my story because it is so atypical.",55,0

The problem is that she‚Äôs constantly failing to respond to calls or texts, and she forgets our scheduled meetings. She has medical issues that contribute to her forgetfulness, and she‚Äôs been traveling, so I‚Äôm sure those factors have contributed to the issue. But this tendency plays on my key trigger/weakness, and it‚Äôs really caused me to struggle. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should end this sponsor relationship or if I‚Äôm getting in my own way (I do that frequently), and maybe this will help me overcome those triggers (assuming I survive them). For now, though, it‚Äôs making me fall into my old disdain for the program.",10,0

This time was supposed to be different. I had been sober for a little bit, but then I found out I was pregnant. A dream I've been waiting for, with a man I love immensely. I immediately dropped smoking cigarettes and weed. Started taking vitamins and eating better, being more active and conscious of what my body needed. Healthiest I've probably ever been.

Suddenly was in severe abdominal pain, went to the hospital and was told it was heartburn from the pregnancy (I knew it wasn't heartburn but they gave me a clean bill of health.) Was told to go home and take some Tylenol and pepcid. 

From that Tuesday I spent the days leading up to Saturday in bed unable to get comfortable yet unable to move much, in excruciating pain, unable to eat or go to the bathroom, but for some reason scared to go back to the hospital just to be told I was fine...I guess? I don't know why I waited so long and in hindsight I'm trying to work on forgiving myself for doing so. 

Went back to the hospital Saturday. Ruptured Appendicitis, now having gone into severe sepsis, but I was told my baby was 6 and a half weeks (my first time knowing how far I was) and that they had found a heartbeat. I was already crying but that got happy tears out of me. However, my intestines had entirely shutdown and I wasn't in good shape. They had to do an emergency surgery that night.

Exactly 1 week from that surgery, I lost my baby in the toilet at home. I knew exactly what was happening, but what could I do besides sit there feeling it falling out of me and wonder which flush of the toilet was my baby's heart. 

Focused on the physical pain I was in as long as I could. Once they took the drains (draining infection from my abdomen/pelvis) out of me and my body was well enough to eat again, I drank again. It hurt. My intestines were not okay with the alcohol. What did I care about my body anymore. My baby died, but my alcoholic, mentally unstable, considerably pathetic self was able to survive. It wasn't right and I spiraled into the bottle. 

Recently my boyfriend demanded I stop because he didn't want to lose me right after having almost lost me...and I knew I desperately needed help. (He's the absolute best partner, but also a ""normie"" and doesn't smoke or drink, he tries to understand the best he can both in regards to the addiction and the miscarriage, but [understandably] struggles with it.) 

I'm trying to be an active member in AA. However, I have social anxiety and am just socially inept in general. On top of chronic depression, anxiety, and Bi polar issues. 

Sorry for writing a book. The gist is that I'm struggling...harder than I can remember ever struggling before. And I'm just so incredibly lost right now.",22,0

I have been sober for 8 months and going to daily meetings, sometimes twice per day. All indications from my sponsor have been that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdoing great‚Äù. Literally every time she shares in a meeting and mentions her sponsee, she says I‚Äôm doing great!  I work a very high stress, time consuming job. A lot of demands. Plus I have a husband and family. We love in separate cities but because of Zoom I met her in a meeting and she asked me to be my temp sponsor. Then as time progresses she became my permanent sponsor. 

She lives 3 hrs away and doesn‚Äôt work or have a family or any other responsibilities. I just returned from a 2 week vacation in Europe and communicated daily with her and Zoomed into meetings each day. Since I have returned she has been pressuring me to travel to her city to sit down with her and meet. I unfortunately haven‚Äôt been able to do this. I just returned a week ago today and I‚Äôm trying to play catch-up with work and everything else in my life. 

Apparently this is not sitting well with her because she started ghosting me four days ago. I have been trying to reach her through text and voicemail for the past four days and she is not returning calls or text messages. I was getting worried about her so I kept trying.Finally today she admits to me via text that she has been being passive aggressive and is mad at me. 

This is a 64-year-old woman that I would expect to act more like an adult and not like this. I told her that I was disappointed that she wasn‚Äôt just upfront with me and told me she was mad at me. When I asked her what she was mad about she said ‚Äúif you can travel all the way to Europe, you can certainly travel 3 hours to meet with your sponsor.‚Äù I told her that if she was upset she should‚Äôve talk to me about this and not just shut me out. If she didn‚Äôt want to be my sponsor she should‚Äôve just been upfront and told me so. It‚Äôs almost like she is jealous in a way that I took a vacation which was the first my husband and I have done in almost 3 years. We have also been dealing with family members who have had Covid and other issues.  

This is just really upsetting to me. The hostility and anger that I felt from her came out of nowhere and I‚Äôm really confused. One thing I do know is that there is no way in hell I will drink over this and I am on the hunt now to find a new sponsor in my own city. I just can‚Äôt believe she reacted like this.

Not drinking or using has been easy for me after the first couple of shaky months. The hard part has been just living in my own skin, since the thinking that led me to drinking and using can still surface from time to time. I've matured, and I've built a lot of spiritual and mental ""muscle"" that gives me the extra seconds or minutes I need to make better choices when confronted with difficulty.

I keep going to meetings a couple times a week because even though I've been sober a long time, my alcoholic brain has been doing push-ups for just as long. I've learned to live with it, but I've never forgot that it's there. That's why listening and working with newcomers is so important to me - your experience is a reminder of how important being sober truly is. I wouldn't be here without you.

I‚Äôm on day 23 of no alcohol, after using alcohol for 12 years to cope with daily emotions and past issues. I come from a military background where alcohol was the social norm to deal with any and all obstacles. After a string of bad decisions (alcohol-influenced) over the last couple months, I decided to stop drinking for awhile. I‚Äôd like to say forever, but I‚Äôm a realist and I don‚Äôt anticipate that being doable. My current goal is to be sober for 1 year to regain control. I was never a daily ‚Äúget hammered‚Äù drinker. I would have 1-2 beers after work, but on weekends I would binge drink from about 10am until bed. I never called myself an alcoholic because it didn‚Äôt affect my work life. 

I‚Äôm not having issues avoiding alcohol, I‚Äôve switched to drinking Bubly (carbonated water) like they‚Äôre beers. However, I think about alcohol nonstop from the time I wake up until the time I fall asleep.

For nothing else matters, except drinking
more booze.




One is too many, a thousand not enough.

You won‚Äôt fill the void, not with that stuff
 


You have hit rock bottom and I I know that it‚Äôs rough.

You can do this my friend you have to be tough.



One day at a time, this is the way.

You know where to go, they call it AA.



Start with step one, admit what is true.

This life of an addict, doesn‚Äôt have to be you.



You will start to feel joy and not always be blue.

Before you know it, you‚Äôll be on step two. 



Leave them a dollar, it won‚Äôt make you feel smaller 

After a month you will feel a bit taller.



Start collecting some chips, soon it‚Äôs a year.

Eventually, I promise, you won‚Äôt want that beer.



You‚Äôll see what I mean when you reach step nine.

I started the NA 12 step program about 10 years ago when I had a heroin addiction.  I never took alcohol seriously and remember sitting in meetings and hearing alcoholics share their experience.  I remember thinking ""yeah, talk to me when you have a heroin problem"".  Alcohol is legal, freely available, and socially acceptable.  A hangover is the worst that can happen with too much alcohol consumption.  Or so I thought.

I had gotten to the point where I was a frequent flyer at the ER for over dose.  I knew this wasn't sustainable and I had a girl that I was interested in marrying but she wouldn't marry me if I was doing hard drugs.  I knew that no matter how much liquor I drank, I never ended up in the hospital for over dose.  Well, I explained to her that I had a lot of childhood trauma and anxiety with panic attacks that absolutely required me to medicate myself.  We made an agreement; I would only drink alcohol and would stop all hard drugs and she wouldn't complain about my drinking.  I was going to control my drinking of course, it wasn't going to be a free-for-all.  I was going to drink in moderation.

Fast forward a few years of hard daily drinking and we tried tapering.  She tried to help me get down to one shot every hour for all 24 hours in a day.  I started fortifying the vodka she was measuring out with everclear instead behind her back.

What I didn't know was that it is possible to drink yourself to such a dependency that your body literally shuts down when you take the liquor away.  Any time I took the heroin away, yeah I felt like I was going to die.  I wished I would die.  But every time I took the heroin away, about 3 days later I was healthier.  About 70 hours after my last drink, my body straight shut down. Nobody has ever died from stopping heroin.  I died from stopping alcohol.

Seizure, respiratory failure, delirium tremens.  Resuscitated intubated and in the ICU for 9 days.  I was hallucinating and in complete pyschosis.  I kept trying to escape and rip my IVs out.  I thought they were trying to steal my brain. On day 12 they told my wife I may never come out of the psychosis.  Wet brain is permanent and real.  We didn't know that was even a thing.  I thought a hangover was the worst that happens to drunks.  Maybe liver failure.  Turns out brain failure is also on the table.

On day 15 I passed some cognitive tests but couldn't walk.  They told me I was going to need a walker to learn how to walk again at 46.  Shit got real that day in the hospital.  They tell me I damaged something in my head and if i drink again, it wont take a very big binge at all to send me back to crazy town and it can be permanent.  The day they let me out of the hospital, all I wanted to do was to hit the liquor store.  I hit an AA meeting instead with the intent of hitting the liquor store after.

A guy bought me a book that day.  I was crying my face off in that meeting because I just couldn't imagine a life without liquor.  I tried to read the book but my brain was so scrambled I could barely read it.  They told me to keep coming back.

I kept coming  back every single day.  Some times multiple times a day. I got a sponsor.  Ive read the book a few times.  I am working the steps and am on step 9.  Its like magic.  Somehow all of those things that I had in my head that absolutely needed to be medicated away have somehow disappeared with the steps.  Today I can imagine without alcohol.  If I stay in contact with my HP and this program today, I think that I will be able to imagine life without alcohol tomorrow too.

If you even think that you may go through severe alcohol withdrawal, please go to the hospital and don't try to do it on your own.  You will make your life easier at the very least and quite possibly save your life altogether.  I wish I would have known about the seriousness and lethality of a good solid case of Delirium Tremens.  It is NOT just a case of the morning shakes like I thought.

2314,328 days....,18,owrv51,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/owrv51/328_days/,2,1627950851.0,"328 days ago I finally caved and admitted my closet alcoholism to my family and took myself to the ER.

I was so miserable my wife wanted to divorce me, my job was suffering and I was getting flack from my managers, I let down my elderly parents that depend on me to help take care of them and my dad ended up in a nursing home. 

I was a yellow swollen mess and could hardly walk. Only going out from my home office to go to the liquor store and back while the wife was at work. I was drinking 1.75L of vodka a day, starting at 7am every morning until I would pass out at 10pm each night. 

I knew I was drinking myself to death, withdrawing every night, not sleeping, getting up and throwing up bile while also bleeding from the nose until I choke down that first glass of vodka in the morning.

20 years of daily drinking and this pandemic/working from home accelerated my alcoholism progression to hyper speed and my body was shutting down.....yellow eyes, flakey psoriasis skin, bleeding, bruising, anger, depression, self hate.....

I spent 10 days detoxing in the hospital and was diagnosed with cirrhosis, a MELD score of 26....doctor said I was headed for the transplant list.

Once released from the hospital I spent 4 months in out patient rehab learning how to function as a person, physical rehab to be able to walk and climb stairs again. I transitioned into AA as my out patient rehab ended.....I found an AA group for beginners that was filled with old timers. The more I listened the more these old timers recognized with me. As a 38 year old male, never would I have thought I would have ended up with the 76 year old sponsor I did, but thank God I did. I was  brought through the steps by my sponsor and i am absorbing every piece of wisdom possible from these old timers. 

Today I am 328 days sober and my liver is functioning properly and I won't need a transplant as long as I never drink again. I have lost 135lbs, I quit the job I hated and got a much better job. My dad Is out of the nursing home and I am there to help take care of him. And my amazing wife is still with me, and today we just had an IVF embryo transfer to try and finally have a child. 

Long story short....drinking is bad, don't do it.",18,0

If I could just drink less I would not be late constantly to dropping my daughter off at school in the morning.  If I could just drink less maybe I would be in less misery.  For years I was oblivious that ""drinking less"" was not possible for me.

Early 2019 my drinking caught up to me and I hit my bottom.  My sales career was tanking, I was late on credit cards/ mortgage, and I was in a very dark depression.  I stayed at home for months only leaving when I absolutely had to drinking myself into oblivion and playing World of Warcraft.  I truly was trying to escape and not feel life.

One drunken late night in tears I wrote an email to my mother.  It was the first time I ever admitted I was an alcoholic and could not stop drinking.  The next morning she begged to take me to rehab but the hungover stubborn alcoholic I was refused.  Trying to think of any other option to help me she looked up AA and called my local intergroup.  The man she spoke to shared his experience and informed her of the time/place that day for a local men's meeting.  She relayed the information to me and I went....  The meeting shocked me that so many other guys had problems just like me and planted a seed of recovery in my head.

Sobriety was very hard for me in the first year.  I was still fighting depression (was seeing mental health professionals as well) and I felt like I had so many problems that were piling up on me.  I would call my sponsor in tears thinking about all my debts and how much I messed up my career.  He would always tell me ""what can you do about it today, even if it's small, focus on what you can do today"".  My mind was truly always in the past or future, never the present.

My 4/5th step was the point where things started to get better.  I was thorough and let everything out.  I feel that on that day I put the past behind me and truly started my new life.

Slowly day by day things got better, felt like a lifetime but something magical happened.  I totally lost the urge to drink. I started working again.  I started learning to live one day at a time.  I started to enjoy life again.

I was able to consolidate my credit card debt and refinance my mortgage.  I have a great job that I am very grateful for and so glad I have this opportunity sober.

It is clear that God's plan for me is expressed through love.  God loved me enough to take me from alleys and jails so that I could be made a useful participant in His world.  My response is to love all of His children through service and by example.  I ask God to help me imitate His love for me through my love for others.

Furthermore, I am GRATEFUL to be an alcoholic. If you are here and just coming to a heart-dropping realization that you might be one of us, please read:

Through the gift of desperation and the 12 steps of AA, I was forced to stare into the face of the issues that had been plaguing my thoughts and actions a decade before I ever took a drink - the selfishness, dishonesty, resent and fear that were woven into the fabric of my being.

Without the disease that was ruining my life and killing me spiritually and physically, they would have been left undiagnosed and untreated, and I would have gone to my grave a miserable, lonely bastard and probably a lot sooner.

I am grateful for every drunken fight, every car accident, every disapproving stare and disgusted look, every night alone, every relationship lost, every morning awakening to a pounding head and racing heart, every second of misery in withdrawal and every broken thing I needed to ""fix"" to make life livable again. Those things got me to the point of breaking down and asking for help - *WANTING* help more than anything.

I am grateful for both relapses through which alcohol kicked my ass even harder and showed me where I had been holding back.

Today, I don't want a drink. The desire is gone - today, at least. God willing, I've had my last drink. But regardless, this journey has led me to *try* to be better and do better.

He has some mental issues from fighting in war a few decades back and now from his benefits he can easily afford to slowly kill himself.

Did we do something wrong? I don't think so. It's just not our time. I am sick of people telling me I am doing something wrong, that it is all my fault. I know I am doing things wrong. I own my part. What I do not need people telling me (quotes):

\-""You're just looking to be abused"" (ex-sponsor)

\-""You need ECT for your depression/bipolar/mental illness"" (not from my psych, from my ex-sponsor)

\-""If you have a problem with multiple things, you are the common denominator"" (implying I am the problem. Yes, I am the common denominator, but so is a black person to racists. That does not make a black person the problem.)

\-""If you do everything right, I won't be in pain/suicidal/depressed/angry etc."" (I have co-occurring disorders. I need my medication for this, not AA. The Big Book tells us to trust doctors in this case).

\-""More will be revealed"" (as a dead body of someone who OD'd is taken out. Said by house manager. Nothing more was said about it, found out he OD'd from someone else)

After a series of subsequent events- being a part of a new homegroup which includes argument-filled business meetings and growing pains of all kinds and majorly fucking up in that business meeting and having to make an amends for hurting someone who just relapsed but still being mortified- I‚Äôve decided that enough is enough and I need to handle some bigger issues that have been festering and that I‚Äôve been ignoring. I have awful Impostor Syndrome. 

My self esteem, or lack there of, is and may always be my biggest character defect. My perfectionism and people-pleasing tendencies stem from it. When I have particularly low self esteem and my spiritual fitness is lacking, I genuinely start believing that I‚Äôm not doing AA ‚Äúcorrectly.‚Äù That a relapse is inevitable because I‚Äôm just incapable of not fucking up. Even having been in the program for 7 months and being 8 months sober on the thirteenth and having gone through all 12 steps, I STILL feel like a failure. I feel like I don‚Äôt belong in the rooms or that people don‚Äôt want me there. I set this IMPOSSIBLE expectation for a relationship with a higher power, which is that it has to be wonderful and fulfilling always and I have psychic changes all the time and that I‚Äôm fundamentally ‚Äúchanged‚Äù by them, and then I‚Äôm mad when I have a period of not so great spiritual fitness. I see other people have amazing relationships with their higher power and who are incredibly enthusiastic about the program, and I just feel like a cynical brat for feeling the way that I do, which is no one‚Äôs fault but mine. It‚Äôs total projection about my own shit. 

I should clarify that I do have mental health issues and I have a kickass therapist and psychiatrist, this is just something I still need to work through, I suppose.

The alcohol would either numb the pain, loneliness, or whatever I was feeling, or it would be enough to act as a kind of 'mental block' or 'limiter' for my brain, where it would just shut my mind down and stop it from being able to think about things for a while. Eventually it would also help by sending me to sleep. Just over a couple of months ago I had a mental breakdown, drank heavily to try and cope with it, and the short version is the state I was in ended up costing me the friendship of my closest friend, the most important person in my life. Since then I forced myself to quit, partially because I of how drinking had ended up in me emotionally hurting someone I care deeply about, and partially as a way for me to try and change, hoping it might help toward redemption and a chance at earning back my friends forgiveness and friendship. 

I successfully managed to cut off cold (a horrid week of withdrawals), and have managed to stay off ever since. However it's all feeling in vain and I'm losing hope, it seems the change is too little too late, and the thought and worry that I can't ever save or repair the friendship is adding more and more to my depression. Each day I'm struggling more and more to cope with my thoughts and pain, without drinking I no longer have any 'block/limiter' to numb my pain or stop my thoughts. The whole day my mind is full of thoughts over what happened, regret, pain of loss, worry over what will happen, and in the last few weeks suicidal thoughts (not immeditate, but a feeling that it's only a matter of time if I can't save the friendship). It feels like my mind is under a constant migrane being crushed with all thoughts constantly swirling around in there at the same time. Sometimes I can barely walk or stand as it just overwhelms my head and I can't function, a few times I've ended up dropping to my knees. At work I've had to go out back as I've just mentally frozen or broken down, and when getting back home I've just collapsed on the bed not able to move as the thoughts get too much. I've barely been able to sleep, the thoughts constantly keeping me awake or waking me up in the form of nightmares over what happened.

I'm starting to think that if stopping drinking wasn't enough of a change and it's never going to help me earn back that friendship then what the hell is the point? Why don't I just drown my sorrows away to at least stop the pain and depression I've been suffering? But then I remember I stopped it because it contriubted to the state I was in that night when I emotionally hurt my friend, and that thought keeps me off of it. I'm doing it for her, even if she never realises it or even cares about it. I just don't know what else to use instead of alcohol, I need something to stop my thoughts, numb me, and shut down my mind, I'm going insane and I don't think I can keeping going on for much longer. I've tried forcing myself with distractions, TV, games etc, but I can't get into anything anymore (a lot reminds me of my friend which is why), I've tried herbal teas, legal botanical narcotics (smoking blue lotus etc), natural & OTC aids (Kalms etc), anti-depressants (perscribed), I'm in therapy, I've tried crisis lines / online support, and none of it is helping, I continue to get worse each day. The only thing I've found that's helpful have been some strong sleeping tablets, however I can't use them everyday as I get resistant to them, so I only end up able to use them for about 1-2 nights per week. I just have no idea what to do or how to cope, there doesn't seem to be anything that works in the way alcohol did. I'm so tempted to turn back to it, more so each day, but I can't, I feel I still owe it to my friend to stay off of it.",11,0

2351,"2 years sober, my journey with alcoholism and now ADHD (long)",16,p1xd6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/p1xd6c/2_years_sober_my_journey_with_alcoholism_and_now/,11,1628626689.0,"This is a long one, so my thanks for any that find their way reading to the end.

I am coming up on two years sober in just two weeks.  Nobody can say with 100% certainty that they won't fall down that particular hole again, but I feel very confident I will hit that anniversary.  Almost two years ago to the day was when I started tapering off of alcohol.

It's been a rough two years, for sure.  Stopping drinking right before the start of a pandemic was not easy.  Staying sober was not easy.  Home schooling children was awful. Discovering my daughter had pretty severe ADHD during the end of the last school year was not easy.  Having Type 1 diabetes is not easy (30 years now).  I am certainly not the only one who had a rough time of it.  I am sure I am not the only one to stay sober throughout either and to be counted as one of them is a moment of pride for me.  (And I am certainly not casting any judgement on anyone who may have slipped.  That is certainly not my place.)

And then there is my personal diagnosis with ADHD.  Specifically Hyperactivity and Inattentive.  

During the process of learning about my daughter's condition, I heard many assessment questions.  And almost all of them set off alarm bells. Yes, I do that.  Yes, that happens to me.  Wait, that is not ""normal?""

So I found a licensed professional and got all the assessments myself.  And what I learned was that yes, I have ADHD.  And due to my above average intelligence (not tooting a horn here, just stating part of the journey), I was able to power through many difficulties growing up.  I taught myself how to learn.  I developed so many coping mechanisms.  And through sheer force of will, I succeeded, got my college degree, and am reasonably successful in my field.  But nothing felt right.  Nothing felt done. And everything was a herculean effort to get anything done.  I felt lost and unfulfilled.  I mean, if I'm a ""genius,"" then why did I struggle so much?  It was depressing.  I was depressed all the time.

Rewind to my dalliances with alcohol starting after I graduated high school, then into the binge drinking of colllege.  It always felt so right to drink.  I never wanted to just drink myself into oblivion.  I just wanted ""that feeling.""  That feeling of bliss that came with the first drink.  And I wanted to maintain it.  Drinking to excess didn't start happening until later.

I got married.  I had kids.  Life happened and I had my drinking under complete control (or so it seemed).  Then I sprained my MCL and my managable alcoholism became very much unmanaged as I used it to treat the pain.  At that same time I found out my wife had had an affair.  Alcohol was now acting as a crutch to function.  And I certainly had a drinking problem, even if I didn't realize it at the time.  (for those curious, my wife and I sought counseling, reconciled, and are about to celebrate 20 years of marriage).

But I got clean.  I didn't hit rock bottom in the classical sense, but I certainly got scared that eventually something would happen.  I didn't want to end up in the hospital or worse.  So I tapered.  I quit.  I ended up exercising and weight lifting and getting fit.  I started drinking a lot of coffee, too. Turns out heavy caffeine consumption is also something untreated ADHD folks do. 

And then came the ADHD diagnosis very recently.  I had made a pact with my daughter that if I did have it, I would accept any medication the doctor thought appropriate and we would grow and go through this journey together.  Our relationship was not great beforehand.  And given both our diagnoses, this makes sense in retrospect.

So I took the prescribed adderall...     And something startling happened.  I felt that rush like I had just had a drink.  Except I didn't want more.  I didn't need to ""maintain.""  I felt focused.  Less fuzzy.  Present.  And most importantly, I simply stopped having any urge to drink while the medication was working.  I even stopped craving coffee.

What I've come to learn is that there is quite a link between alcoholism and ADHD.  My brain just doesn't make enough dopamine.  But drinking alcohol releases dopamine at first.  That's why I always felt more focused after a drink.  But we all know how that slippery slope goes.  So now, with the adderall (which is really just an amphetamine), it activates my dopamine production and actually relaxes me (unlike non-ADHD people).

It was very liberating to learn that the start of my abuse of alcohol was a biological one.  I feel totally exonerated for starting to drink.  It is important to note that I continue to own who I became while drinking and take complete ownership for my actions while drinking.  But that urge to drink...  I may never have had to go through what I went through if diagnosis would have been better in the 80s or 90s.  How much further I could have gone.  But the past is the past and I am now content with my life.

Things are much better now.  My daughter and I are growing and getting closer.  I see happiness on the horizon.  It's nice being more relaxed, less angry, more present.

So thank you for reading about the first two years of my journey through sobriety.  I look forward to a sober tomorrow.  Every day is just one more day and that is good.

If any of my story strikes a chord in any reader, I implore you to take an online assessment.  If that comes back leaning towards ADHD, find a professional that focuses on adult-diagnosis ADHD.  Get treatment if you want it and see if it helps.  It's never too late for self discovery.  It's never too late to feel better about your life.  

Thank you for your time.",16,0

Before that last week-long bender, I‚Äôd had almost 2 full years of not drinking. After that last week-long bender my entire life and everything I cared about was lying at my feet, broken.

The book talks about a jumping off place. At this point it was a binary decision: Live/Die.

And I decided Die. I spent a couple of days researching the best way to do it. And on my way out to the garage to hang myself, I found myself on the phone with my sponsor. Ten minutes later he was at my house. He dragged me to a meeting.

That was my higher power doing for me what I could not do for myself. Grace.

In the meeting my sponsor dragged me to, I heard a woman say ‚ÄúEvery morning, I wake up and give my alcoholism to my higher power.‚Äù And she made a little gesture of pushing something across a table. That gesture penetrated my brain.

I‚Äôd never seen that woman in a meeting before, or since. I thought ‚ÄúI can do that, maybe.‚Äù

The next day I went to the Men‚Äôs Meeting. Big Brian shared what was basically my story of multiple attempts over multiple years of trying half-assed to get sober. He was sober several years at this point and he said something that cut through my denial.

‚ÄúThe only difference in this time and all them other times is I learned how to pray.""

So I went home that night and knelt by the side of my bed and said ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. It was the first sincere prayer that I‚Äôd ever said. I didn‚Äôt know where the prayer was going or if anyone was listening, but I prayed anyway, because if it worked for Big Brian, maybe it would work for me.

‚ÄúPlease help me.‚Äù I have said that same prayer every day since. I don‚Äôt know why it works.

It wasn‚Äôt until after doing an honest and complete 4th and 5th Step that the obsession was finally removed. I learned that Steps 6 and 7 are the heart of Recovery. I did 8 and 9 to the best of my ability. I make prompt amends when I so something selfish or hurtful today.

I try to stay in today. I try to not make everything about me. I don‚Äôt know why it works.

I tried for seven years to do it differently, only using the parts of the AA program that I felt right for me. I need every part of the AA program to remain sober one day at a time. I need the book, the meetings, the fellowship, the Steps, the prayers - all of it.

Self-will didn‚Äôt work for me. Half-measures didn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm grateful I learned that.

Even after I failed and failed and failed again, AA allowed me to keep coming back until I heard a couple of things that cut through my bullshit. And when I finally begged a higher power that I didn't really believe in for help, things began to change for me.

Today I have a life filled with love and serenity and joy. I don‚Äôt know why AA works for me.

I only know that it does.

Keep coming back.",100,0

We live apart but we're at a stage where we are talking about moving in together. My boyfriend goes through stages of drinking since I met him... sometimes less sometimes more but it's been consistent. I've seen him stop drinking periodically but it doesn't last long at all maybe a week here and there but that's been the most. 

He goes to work he pays his bills but soon after he gets out of work and home the drinking starts. Sometimes he drinks with others sometimes I find him drunk in the kitchen alone.. Lately he's been drinking Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday which are his days off and I'm sure he's having drinks between work days too he won't admit to. All his friends drink like this too outside of his job. I'm to the point where I can't stomach it anymore. He's drinking at least a 12 pack on average on the days he drinks.

I've said he needs help and can't be with somebody where this is an all the time thing. He's obnoxious and mean when he's drinking. A majority of our fights have started while he drunk.He admits he has a problem at times and other times he thinks it's not a big deal. He has a history of trauma including combat trauma and that's his reasoning behind drinking. 

He's an amazing loving man when he's sober but he changes colors when he drinks enough. He's hard to be with drunk and I never know what drunk version of him that ill get the mean one or a tolerable one. It's mean more then tolerable  

I don't know what to do anymore. He won't do therapy he won't go to AA. He doesn't talk to his friends about this and they drink too more recreational then coping but they drink enough where it's one of their main hobbies. 

I'm a nurse so it's especially hard because I've explained that to him the co sequences of his drinking. I used to work on a liver transplant unit and he just doesn't care at times. When he does care it's 3mpty promises to lower the intake.",29,0

I've realized what alcohol has robbed from me, that I chose beer over everything that is really important in life. So I'm not currently worried about relapsing, even with these feelings. Is this normal? Adjusting to life without alcohol and all the dopamine that I was use to? I know this will sound like paranoia, but could it be some type of permanent brain damage? My memory is terrible suddenly, but im admittedly more stressed and depressed then ever, which can greatly effect memory. 

I'm new to this lifestyle, as well as being open and asking for help. I suppose I'm looking for reassurance, knowing that it's normal (ish) and that things will get better. The long road is easier to drive if you know you're going in the right direction.

I‚Äôm (26/f) here because I‚Äôm too embarrassed to ask my doctor for help, or admit anything to anyone about my problem. 

I have drank every night and I can‚Äôt even remember how long I‚Äôve been doing this. I would say since June to be safe. A night consists typically of 5-8 white claws, or a bottle and a half of wine before sleeping. 

I am not sure if it‚Äôs a myth but I have heard if you abruptly stop your cycle of drinking it can cause be harmful to your health, which as someone with extreme health anxiety and pandemic round 2 cannot risk any potential damaging negative side effects (if there are).

I have gone a 1-3 days without drinking (a month or two ago) and the side effects would be night one no alc, falling asleep and jerking awake every hour. After night one I feel fine in the past but I have been consistently drinking for longer than I have before.

I work as a bartender. I know that sounds crazy but it pays well, has good benefits and I'm newly married and trying to stack money as much as possible. Plus I have no other skills, no college history etc. 

I was charged with making a batch of sangria for a function. I made it. I was waiting for a coworker to come taste test it for me to see if it needed any other ingredients. He was taking a while, so without even thinking I dipped a straw in and put some on my tongue. I spit it out, and added more ingredients. Tried another straw full. This time I swallowed it. 

Before I knew it I was pouring sangria into a cup and chugging it, over and over. Then I snapped out of it, ""what am I doing""  I thought. So I continued cleaning up to end my shift. Went back for another cup of sangria. I had 5 or 6 cups of it. Finally ended my shift. While waiting outside for my ride, I went back to the bar, grabbed a brand new bottle of scotch, ripped off the top and took a big swig right out of the bottle before going home to my wife. 

I brushed my teeth, used mouthwash, ate a bunch of breath mints and had some food. I have yet to tell her. I'm working all day today and am absolutely dreading telling her when I get home.

How am I gonna tell her? What am I gonna say to my mother? I tortured my poor mother for years. She was finally free from worry. Now I'm about to send her right back to worrying 24/7.

Over half a decade sober only to throw it all away for nothing. For seemingly no reason. There was barely any thought to what I did, just impulse. I feel like a complete failure. Sobriety was one of the few things in life I can say I was proud of. Now what?

My names Amber and I‚Äôm definitely an alcoholic. I‚Äôve been drinking for the last 15 years or so and been trying to get sober for the last year. The furthest I‚Äôve made it is this most recent stint at 92 days. Relapsed this past Saturday. Got kicked out of my sober living facility and have been living out of my car since. I‚Äôve lost everything and know I‚Äôve just been trying to kill myself for the last 10 years or so. Anyways, I guess my question is this: I see so many who have lost it all but still want to live so they fight. What am I missing? 
I just don‚Äôt have any fight in me. I don‚Äôt see the point in getting sober anymore. Before I tried because I worried about what my family would do/say/think and it worked for a few months but here I am again. I think I want to live‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm not actively suicidal just think it‚Äôs all pointless. Because live for what? To see another day sober? Idk‚Ä¶.I want the will to live.

I just got home from a doctors appointment. I have a lot of chronic health problems, one of them being fatty liver. My ultrasound showed mild a year ago when I had it. Blood work was elevated about a year ago but has been consistently normal. I get liver pain, especially after drinking. I‚Äôve never had a fibroscan even though I pushed and pushed. I also know you can have damage even with normal ALT AST.

So here I was at my appointment, listening to myself talk as my anxiety has spiraled out of control. I also have severe health anxiety. I was honest that I don‚Äôt drink nightly but when I do, it‚Äôs 3-5 drinks. Sometimes it is nightly a few days in a row. When I asked for reassurance regarding my liver, she said ‚ÄúYou need to abstain or your liver won‚Äôt be okay.‚Äù This was my wake up call. I don‚Äôt know why but it felt so powerful to hear it from my doctor. 

So here I go, on my journey to sobriety. I‚Äôve had so many day 1‚Äôs and that can‚Äôt happen anymore. I don‚Äôt know if I feel ready but I have to be. This is for me. While it feels like this is a negative, like a HUGE loss that I‚Äôm grieving‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm realizing I need to look at this as a positive, as a win, as freedom. 

As I head into my journey I do not want to do AA but I am wondering if there is a support person that can help me. Like a sponsor but just a support person that I could call or text on hard days. Someone that‚Äôs sober. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden but know I‚Äôll need support and encouragement, especially on weekends. Anyone out there?

My relapse began in my early 40‚Äôs and lasted almost 4 years. üòû I have now been gratefully sober for a little over 2 years. I‚Äôm 48 years old. 

That 4ish? year relapse almost killed me, and definitely killed every important relationship I had. This is what happens when an alcoholic is active in their addiction. Nothing and no one is sacred or protected from the consequences of their choices.

I fight daily to have half of the strength my disease does. (Yes, it‚Äôs a disease) The almost 20 years of sobriety I had were no match for my alcoholic make up, even with all of that time and knowledge of my issues under my belt. I talked myself into the insanity and made the choice to drink. üòû My disease was far worse than it was in my 20s almost immediately. üòû

I‚Äôm STILL trying to rebuild all that I lost. I share my struggles and victories publicly today because I fell flat on my face publicly - I want the world to see that I‚Äôm trying, I‚Äôm working, I‚Äôm doing everything I can to just do the next right thing - and this shit is HARD!!!! 
Trying to repair broken trust and build new foundations in to old relationships that have been tarnished, is fucking hard!

I have been sober for 759 days now. I stopped drinking cold turkey because the last two times that I drank, my hands would shake, I felt physically sick for a few days after I would drink, and my anxiety for the next week or two would be through the roof. I felt like something bad was going to happen, in a funk, panicky, it just got to a point where I asked "" Why do I keep doing this. Fuck this."" So I stopped drinking. Initially I thought I would just take a few weeks off from drinking, but then weeks turned into months, and then the pandemic hit and it made it easier for me to stay home, not go out with friends and drink. 

BACK STORY: Before I quit drinking, my early to mid 20's I  was in college, drank a lot, partied a lot, and looking back, I also blacked out a lot. A very social drinker. I never drank on my own, or had cravings for drinks, I only drank at parties or social gatherings. However, when I would drink, I found that I would often overdo it. When I was young and in college, I did not notice how drunk I would get because everyone else seemed to be just as drunk as I was. Once I was out of college, my drinking slowed down dramatically, because I was going out to parties less, working full time, etc. But when I would hang out with friends, I would drink in excess. Luckily, at this point in my life, I was a ""happy drunk"". I would dance, have fun, laugh, be very outgoing, but just really drunk. 

This all changed after my father passed away from cancer in 2016. Immediately after he passed away, I started dealing with some really bad depression. I still wouldn't drink on my own, or crave drinks, but again, when I did make myself get out the house to meet up with family or friends for dinner or drinks, I would overdo it, but this time id be emotional/crying and blacking out, just an emotional mess. One of those nights included me blacking out at a bar, waking up with my head cracked open, vomiting all over myself in the hospital, and needing stitches to close the gash over my eye. Till this day, I don't remember what happened. And to be honest from 2016 to 2018ish maybe even into 2019, there are nights that I do not remember at all, where there are pictures of me out with people having fun, but I have no recollection of those events. I think it is a combination of the severe depression along with the alcohol, where I just can't seem to remember months at a time. Honestly it is all a blur.

So fast forward to 2019, in early July I went out to brunch for a friends birthday. This was the first time where I noticed after two drinks my hands began to shake, I felt really paranoid, and in retrospect I think I was having a panic attack. I did not know it at the time but looking back, I think thats what it was. After this day, I took about two weeks off from drinking, until my cousins 21st birthday that we were going to celebrate in Las Vegas. First night out, I felt fine and happy, but after two drinks, I immediately black out and cannot remember the rest of the night. The next morning my hands were still shaking, my anxiety was crippling and I could not leave the hotel room the entire day. I went out at night with everyone since it was the last night, but I didn't really drink and tried to play it off as best as I could. July 27th, 2019 was the last time I drank. 

So July 2019, I stop drinking cold turkey, and figure ill take some time off from drinking. I still smoked weed at this point, I found it helped with my anxiety, helped me sleep at night, and it felt good to smoke and listen to music (which is one of my passions in life), watch movies, etc. However, once the pandemic hit and everything was closing down, my only outings twice a month were for groceries, and weed. One of the days, the line at the shop was long, and I started thinking, if I get COVID from being at this weed shop and I die, or someone in my family dies, that will be the stupidest shit ever. I still bought weed that day, but stopped smoking  soon after (385 days with no weed). 

So I have been sober from alcohol 759 days and weed 385 days. 

I have gotten used to not drinking in smaller social gatherings since, however, I have two bachelor parties coming up and two weddings coming up. I feel like I am in a way better place with my anxiety and depression. I have been considering drinking, because I feel like I am in a better place. BUT I HAVE SOME DOUBTS & QUESTIONS. 

**I apologize in advance if these questions trigger anyone, I do not know where else to go and would appreciate any advice or help.** 

My questions:

How do you know if you're a person that should never touch a drop of alcohol ever again? 

How do I know if I am in  ""a better place"" only ***BECAUSE*** I'm sober or if it is my mental health that has improved and I can drink again? 

How can I know how I will react with alcohol if I don't see how I am with it in my improved current mental state?

Its not the first time. But I need it to be the last.

I had a gallbladder attack the following Sunday, was in the hospital 2 days, needed the gallbladder removed on an emergency basis, and was released that Tuesday. The doctors also talked to me about my addiction and detoxed me. 

I haven't really had time to think about drinking since my recovery. I was given 2 weeks off work as well. But yesterday my family and I went out to an event (my first time going out since the gallbladder episode) and there was beer everywhere. I felt like I was gonna crawl out of my skin. But I didn't fold. My family was kind enough to abstain as well. 

But today the cravings are back. First time having cravings since this whole thing started. So I have ordered non-alcoholic beer. I've heard mixed opinions about this. Most the people I've talked to that I know PERSONALLY swear by it and said it helped them quit in the early stages when cravings were still running rampant. On the other hand, I've heard other people on the internet claim it made them miss the real thing that much more. 

Anyone have any experience with this? And yes I am going to AA meetings starting this week (that seems to be the go-to comment whenever I post in here, so might as well establish that now lol).

2417,It's a hateful disease,16,pdn7lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pdn7lm/its_a_hateful_disease/,1,1630204889.0,"Before I got sober, I hurt my family being drunk often.  I brought strife onto them, pouring on the liquor night after night, I didn't give a crap about anybody but myself.  With nowhere for them to go, my hateful disease held them hostage in our home.  That's was more than 2 years ago.

Today, I'm working with a dear friend in very early sobriety.  Just after returning home from an AA meeting last night, their spouse was drunk - angry drunk, and started throwing furniture onto the lawn.  Their young child was there and the home was filled with fright.  It reminded me this hateful disease of alcoholism is still at large.  Ruining families and breaking the hearts of children.  It seems hopeless, but my own early sobriety had similar challenges.  Change is hard, and scary sometimes for those around us, especially a spouse who also drinks.

I persisted with my AA program regardless of how troubling things got at home, going to meetings nearly every day and talking with my sponsor.  I couldn't solve the problem that my spouse was going to keep drinking, sometimes in my face, but my Higher Power could!!!  I had no idea it was coming.  About a year into my sobriety my spouse said, ""I'm done with drinking"" and walked away from it.  We don't fight over nonsense anymore.  My kids don't say, ""Please, stop fighting, go to bed!  Your just saying the same things over and over and it doesn't even make any sense.""  We're still together and it's a happy home on a regular basis.

I'm grateful for the program and for the people here that taught me how to live sober, without the crutch of a drink.  Before AA, I believed it 'as a fact' that I could not live without drinking and today it's the entire opposite, I could not see living any day with drinking.  For me, alcoholism is just too hateful to those I love.",16,0
2418,Unpopular Opinion: AA is not the end-all be-all,49,pdnnpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pdnnpy/unpopular_opinion_aa_is_not_the_endall_beall/,103,1630206762.0,"So I've been apart of this community for awhile now and I can't help but consider un-joining. There seems to be a large number of preachy, judgmental people that have presumably been sober for years that seem to intentionally seek out newcomers and tear them down. Not sure if it makes them feel superior because they have 20, 30 years under their belt, or what. But I feel we have to remember that no matter where we are in our journey, we all started exactly the same. Whether we're a day sober or 10 years, no one should feel superior or inferior to anyone. 

This leads me to my next point. I've seen a lot of people on this Sub comment that AA seems like a cult. I don't believe it's a cult and I do plan to go to my first meeting in awhile this Tuesday at my local church. But I understand and accept that it's not for everyone. If someone is an atheist or just doesn't like the group setting they shouldn't feel pressured to join AA. I know tons of people that got sober without AA. It's not the one and only solution to sobriety. Don't try to shove it down someone's throat if it's just not their cup of tea. 

CONTEXT: this has happened three times now and I actually had to block a fellow Redditor for just being a combative, argumentative jerk. For context, I decided to quit drinking on Thursday the 12th. That Sunday I had a massive gallbladder attack (very severe pain, 10/10 EASILY) that landed me in the E.R. Turns out a stone was blocking my bile duct and it needed to be removed immediately. I had my entire gallbladder removed that Tuesday. I was stuck in the hospital for 2 days. Due to the covid surge I couldn't even get my own room. I was stuck in the E.R. for 2 days. I wasn't allowed visitors. My phone died. No TV (obviously). The doctors also talked to me about my alcoholism and detoxed me. I was all alone with just my thoughts. It very much felt like an inpatient rehab. The doctors scared me straight and told me I'd have liver cancer and failure in 10 years if I don't stop. It was my rock bottom. Not to mention my current boyfriend almost left me right before my hospitalization due to my drinking. My life was basically threatening to fall apart. This just cemented the fact I no longer have a choice. I HAVE to quit. 

I've quit cold turkey before. Without rehab or AA. I went 9 months without booze when I was pregnant with my daughter who is now going on 3. I probably had the strength to not start up again but sadly I did. I went through a lot of trauma with my ex husband and the divorce from hell that caused me to start drinking again. I've quit for months at a time in the past 3 years, but this cycle seemed unbreakable. I've been seeing a therapist regularly every other week, but to ensure I don't go back to that darkness I plan to go to AA. My first meeting is this Tuesday and I even have a friend going with me to hold me accountable. 

But this isn't good enough for some of the snobs on this Sub. I've been asked by THREE different people why I've waited two weeks to go to a meeting. They've insinuated I'm ""making excuses"" or I ""don't really want to quit drinking"". I even got told by one person that I'll NOT go to this week's meeting and postpone and postpone. This is simply not true. And 2 out of 3 people backed off when I explained that I just had a MAJOR surgery. I've been given 2 weeks off work (actually the doctor added a few more days because I was recovering SLOWER than expected). I could not sit up straight or even walk without intense pain up until yesterday. I was doped up on various meds which I've only been able to cut down on in the past couple days. I made plans to go to an AA meeting once I PHYSICALLY felt up to it. But this one rude guy kept insinuating I was making excuses and not ready to quit. Um, I've gone 2 weeks and 2 days without it and I already made plans to go to a meeting this Tuesday based on my physical ability to manage my current pain threshold. But I think this guy was projecting or just wanting to argue. 

Clearly these people have never had a major surgery like having an organ removed. Like what, should I have asked my local church to host the AA meeting in the post-op unit of the hospital?

I don't know. It just makes me mad that I'm sitting here trying to recover and people are jumping down my throat. I'm not even allowed to lift my own toddler for another 2 weeks, and have temporarily moved back in with my parents for help with her because my boyfriend works crazy hours. My parents have been supportive and held me accountable too. I voluntarily surrendered my ID to my boyfriend to remove all temptation and my parents have gotten rid of all alcohol in their house as well. So I have a strong support system. 

I just don't understand the mindset on here of ""you need to go to a meeting and you need to go to one NOW. NO EXCUSES."" Like I said, I personally do plan on attending a meeting this week (and no I'm not backing out, hence why I found a buddy to keep me accountable. I also plan on asking for a sponsor). But I can also see why some people don't like the idea of it or consider it to be a ""cult"". It's not the end-all be-all and you can't say every single alcoholic on the planet MUST join AA if they have any hope of quitting. It should be respected that it's not everyone's cup of tea and different things work for different people. And I certainly don't think I deserved to be attacked because I didn't get off my bedridden butt to attend a meeting even though my pain was so intense I could hardly walk for an entire week and a half.",49,0

We are sure that humility, expressed by anonymity, is the greatest safeguard that Alcoholics Anonymous can ever have.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 187

Since there are no rules in A.A. I place myself where I want to be, and so I choose anonymity.  I want my God to use me, humbly, as one of His tools in this program.  Sacrifice is the art of giving of myself freely, allowing humility to replace my ego.  With sobriety, I suppress that urge to cry out to the world, 'I am a member of A.A.' and I experience inner joy and peace.  I let people see the changes in me and hope they will ask what happened to me.  I place the principles of spirituality ahead of judging, fault-finding, and criticism.  I want love and caring in my group, so I can grow.

And just because I can't explain or control it doesn't mean it isn't  valid and true.  It's just true beyond my perceptions.  And there in  that moment as I came to this understanding, I, an alcoholic, could feel  the craving to drink lifted from me.  Because I knew I wasn't the one  driving the bus.

I have a higher  power, literally everything that isn't me.  The powers outside I could  never hope to understand.  So I tip my hat to the rest of literal  everything, or as I call it, what God is made out of.  My higher power  is literal everything, and I found it in the weeds in 2012.",22,0

I didn't have to pledge undying love.  Here, strangers hugged me. 'It gets better,' they said, and 'One day at a time, you can do it.'  They were no longer strangers, but caring friends.  I ask God to help me to reach out to people desiring sobriety, and to, please, keep me grateful!

AA is not a Religious program. It's a spiritual one. The main problem we drinkers and druggies face is the overwhelming self absorption of our own problems and the need to control everything outside of ourselves in order to fix them. When all this fails, we begin to feel down on ourselves and turn to the bottle as an escape. What AA does is help you look inside yourself to fix the route of all these problems. You'll find that when you fix your inner world, your outer world will start to come together too. This is done in a 12 step map that is easy to follow and has confirmed results. What people don't realize is that normal, healthy, everyday people already unconsciously live by these steps. Think of it like wearing a pair of glasses. Let's say that everyone in the world has a pair that they see the world through. However, every time something tragic or traumatic happens to you, your glasses smudge. What the AA program does is clean your smudged glasses so you can began to see the world, others, and yourself clearly again.

I thought if I tried counselling I'd get it under control.

I turned up to sessions drunk and eventually stopped going.

I thought if I for the right diagnosis and right meds I'd get it under control.

I drank on the meds anyway.

Lockdown took me to whole new levels where im drunk in work zoom calls, giving presentations to inspire people while being secretly drunk.

I've been¬† getting away with it for years and despite thinking ""oh she enjoys a drink"", no one knows how much I depend on it. Yesterday I haven't felt so depressed in a long time. Nothing in my head, can't move...and I realise I use alcohol for every single emotional (even the good ones) when it gets uncomfortable. It was okay till it wasn't. Now the hangovers leave me so anxious I cant leave the house, I cant even go to the shop because if someone talks to me ill take a panic attack...unless I drink.

I have 6 interviews this week...and in my younger days I'd drink though interviews to perform without fear of a panic attack. Yesterday I looked at 6 of these knowing my body is ill, I threw up on my sofa the night before, and wet myself a few weeks prior. Im not even angry at myself anymore but im so tired of trying to carry this on my back along with what everyone else expects of me.

I couldn't ever see a future without alcohol. Not really. Today is the first time I've seen its not coming from a place of bravery but from a place of sudden brutal honesty. Im an addict. Im an alcoholic. I surrender to it because if I don't ill die.

Really nervous about the meeting. One of the things I struggle with is crying in front of people and I just know its going to happen. Any tips would be great.

Normally I don't cry at all ...like even when I want to. Apparently I have adhd/ ptsd from a violent childhood and docs always put it down to that but every time I think of going to this meeting and accepting what I am its like I cant stop welling up and crying.

I came to AA a broken and bankrupt (financially, morally, emotionally) person. Seven years on, I'm growing into the person I feel I was meant to be, living honestly and with integrity. 

If you're struggling with alcoholism or drug addiction, please don't lose hope! There is a way up and a way out of the cesspool of addiction; happiness is available! It works. It really does.

I'm 33 and drank daily for probly 10 years. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety even before alcohol as a kid. I am 4 months sober but am still on a fairly low dose of valium. In the past 7 years My mother Died at 52 of colon cancer, I lost my eye in a work accident and couldn't work for 5 years and my father is in the late stages of alzheimers at 63. For these reasons I went down the rabbit hole of alcohol, antidepressants that never seemed to work untill finally my psychiatrist said just to make it through I should consider daily valium instead of as needed. I take 7.5 mg a day 2.5mg morning and 5mg at night. I recently had to stop welbutrin due to allergic reaction and stopped mirtazipine due to tiredness after 4 years on it. My problem is my brain. Is complete mush. I can't concentrate, my memory seems shot and I am depressed. My psychiatrist has knows me since 14 and said that this could be that my brain is still recovering from the drinking and may take longer than 4 months. We are going to taper valium slowly as I've been on it around 2 years daily. My question is has anyone been here? I'm worried my brain won't heal if I'm taking the valium but psychiatrist said it very low dose and safer than alcohol as far as brain damage. I exercises daily and eat well.

I partied hard in college, but no harder than anyone else.

After a few years out I realized I was still drinking socially and ocassionally after a workday eventhough it just numbed my emotions and made things worse.

I mean like I would drink 1-2 drinks a week, and possibly 5-6 on a night out. In college those numbers were 3-4 week and 7-8 on an ocasional night out.

Never blacked out, never been in trouble, never hid my drinking, though I have made some dumb choices when drunk.

After a while alcohol stopped agreeing with me. So I decided to stop. I notice that it's challenging, that my friends pressure me, and that alcohol is actually a very common thing around my life. I associate it with fun and it's hard to have fun without it.

I realized it was challenging to stop, so I decided to go to 2 AA meetings this weekend.

The stories I heard were so terrible, the amount of alcohol so drastic, that I really felt like I didn't belong.

Is AA for alcoholics or for anyone who simply wants to stop drinking? I really feel I don't belong. I'm confused about what support system I can have. Any advice? Anyone here a moderate drinker who found success with AA?",11,0

I‚Äôd tell myself it‚Äôs genetic, but I don‚Äôt deserve to give myself an easy out. Definitely feels like there‚Äôs poison in my veins instead of blood though. Or a think black tar, oozing through my heart like a damn sickness. Hope it‚Äôs terminal. I‚Äôll raise a fucking glass to that‚Ä¶ 4 months this time. Don‚Äôt know why I even bothered trying again. What‚Äôs the point of staying sober? It‚Äôs changes nothing. Even going sober for a year didn‚Äôt help. Should‚Äôve learned my lesson after that. Hell, it‚Äôs actually worse in a lot of ways. And if it doesn‚Äôt make me feel any better, what‚Äôs the goddamn point? Then again there‚Äôs not really a point to anything‚Ä¶

At least being drunk is filling in time. Serves as a distraction from the constant loop of suicidal thoughts always playing in my goddamn head. Nothing else distracts me from it. It‚Äôs like my personal Final Destination film up there. Hell, it‚Äôs more like 5 Final Destination films. Guess I‚Äôve always been creative, just wish I could use it for coming up with something other than new and exciting ways to kill myself. 

Medication doesn‚Äôt work. Therapy doesn‚Äôt work. Hell, I ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù with my latest therapist earlier today. Sat on the phone with him and endured him telling me about how great it‚Äôs gonna be when we‚Äôre outta lockdown in a couple weeks. Told him before, makes no difference to me. I don‚Äôt go anywhere anyway. Nothing to do, no one to see. Lockdown is just business as goddamn usual. I don‚Äôt give a shit about the virus or the situation or any of this. 

Only thing that bothers me about COVID is that apparently if you‚Äôve got mental issues nowadays, everyone assumes it‚Äôs cause of that. It‚Äôs like therapists and shit refuse to believe it‚Äôs possible for someone to not give two shits about any of it because life sucked long before the fucking pandemic showed up on the scene and it‚Äôll suck long after it‚Äôs gone. I don‚Äôt leave the house and death sounds like a dream to me, so what the hell would I be distressed about?

Anyway, 15 minutes of explaining all this once again and the dude just goes silent, like he doesn‚Äôt know how to handle someone as far in the pit as I am. Not sure what clients he expects in that field, but maybe I really am an overachiever when it comes to being suicidally depressed. Either way, I just told him this shit isn‚Äôt helping and told him I don‚Äôt need his services anymore. He thanked me for my ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù. Hah. Closest thing to funny I‚Äôve heard in a while. ‚ÄòCept for the sick joke I call my life, think that one will always be on top.

And so here I am, worthless damn loser, drinking alone once again. Cause I‚Äôm a goddamn failure. A miserable alcoholic. Just like my worthless, piece of shit father.

After drinking my first year of college, none of my roommates wanted to live with me anymore and they felt strong enough about it to warn all our other friends not to move in with me. I moved in with my girlfriend and we drank our nights away. I never graduated.

Ten years later, my drinking never quite seemed to get any better. People were moving on with careers and families, I had a sense I was being left behind.  I knew it as a fact, there was no way to quit and that no one on earth could help me. I thought if only I could take 5 months off from work to hike the Appalachian Trail (AT) I would be isolated enough from my drinking buddies and my drinking lifestyle, that would have to do the trick.  I‚Äôd had no choice but to be sober out there on the trail, it would be hard to find anything to drink with just the contents of my backpack.

That false mindset, a fake belief that I could only get sober by being on what amounted to a deserted island, was exactly what my disease told me to keep me drinking. I was never able to quit work and hike the AT.  I kept working and drinking another ten years. The truth is AA WOULD have worked and it doesn't require me to quit my job to do it!

I was hiking today, as this all came back to me. I realized that whenever I start romanticizing having a drink, it‚Äôs always tied to some past feeling. An experience that is long since gone, and simply does not exist anymore. Drinking is never going to bring back this old sensation that only lives in my memories. The AT isn‚Äôt going to get me sober. But when I start working the AA program with honest intentions, I can get sober. One day at a time.",18,0

I‚Äôm a 24 year old male who has been drinking and smoking weed daily since sophomore year of college.

I admitted to myself several months ago that I‚Äôm an alcoholic, plain and simple. Ever since then I‚Äôve been trying to navigate the challenging journey of sobriety with several failed attempts. 

I would stop for a few days and then think I had everything under control. How wrong I was. The day after having a drink I‚Äôd find myself waiting at the liquor store at 11am waiting for it to open so I could have my six pack and then smoke half a gram of distillate (85% thc). 

My first failed attempts were a result of me only putting one foot forward and not both. I thought to mysef ‚ÄúI‚Äôll smoke weed to help take my mind off the alcohol,‚Äù but as i‚Äôm sure others can relate to, that only made my cravings worse. Not just that, but it made my thinking and decision making skills go out the window. Of course I ended right back at square one.. But not this time. 

I‚Äôm 7.5 days totally sober and am feeling much more optimistic in life. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the first 4 days were brutal. I had night sweats, hands shaking, incredibly irratible mood, but I knew that this was just my brain chemistry changing and the process of toxin removal had begun. I found what helps me most is reading what others have gone through and what works for them. Knowing i‚Äôm not alone in this journey has brought some peace of mind and given me confidence. 

That being said, I know my journey has just begun and I have an enormous amount of work to do. Here are some tips that have been helpful to me thus far in the early stages:

1) Exercise daily and go for walks. This helps take my mind off the cravings in a healthy way.

2) Tell your loved ones and close friends about your intentions to stay sober. Nothing is worse than having a family member or girlfriend asking if you want a beer (atleast for me during the early stages, hopefully this will pass).

3) Listen to podcasts. This is a great way to combat bordom and there are so many different topics to listen to.

4) Netflix/Video games/music/hobbies/sports all help immerse yoursef in something other than drinking.

Alcohol snuck up on me. My father was a severe alcoholic my entire childhood until he quit when I was 18. I started drinking ‚Äúsocially‚Äù when I was 14 and always struggled with knowing when to stop, but only drank a couple of times per month (if that) when I went out to parties with friends. 

Alcohol had never been an issue for me, other than a few blackout nights here and there during my high school years. Skip forward a few years. I didn‚Äôt begin drinking frequently (2-4 times weekly) until October of 2019. I was just getting over a severe injury and was unable to walk for 4 months. Around this time is when I also got into a relationship with my first serious boyfriend. He previously struggled with benzo addiction and had been clean for a few months before we began dating. He remained clean our entire relationship and it was never an issue, but drinking was. He drank 4-5 nights per week and after a rough night would wake up and start drinking straight away. 

Already having some struggles with knowing when to stop, I slowly but surely picked up on these bad habits and before I knew it was drinking significantly more than him. I was ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù, never lost my job, didn‚Äôt get in any trouble with the law, etc. From the outside you would have never known, but close friends and family knew there was something going on. 

Eventually our relationship came to and end and I knew my drinking had to as well. After a couple of relapses I successfully quit drinking in late February. I didn‚Äôt drink for five months. During this time I grew and changed a LOT as a person. My entire perspective on alcohol (and life tbh) changed. This entire time I‚Äôve been working with a therapist and she‚Äôs been great. For a while I thought I would never drink again, but my feelings slowly changed on that. I hated having this thing in my life that I wasn‚Äôt in control of, and having this strict rules on myself. I felt like my entire life revolved around not drinking, and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt enjoy my 20s having such a strict mentality. I wished so badly that I could join my friends going to wineries, going out on the weekends, etc. I tried hard to find other sober friends in my area in their early 20s but was unsuccessful. 

I decided I wanted to try drinking again, this time with balance. I started drinking again in august with intentions to just drink when I‚Äôm going out with friends. I don‚Äôt have any desire to get home from work and drink, drink alone, etc. I just simply want to be able to live my life, let loose here and there, and enjoy weekend drinks with friends. My therapist is on board with this. So far I‚Äôve been successful, however the past couple of weekends I‚Äôve consecutively gone out and I‚Äôve had a hard time knowing when to stop. Nothing bad happened, but it really scared me. It makes me think that this is something I might not be able to have in my life and control. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, do I chalk it up to being a hiccup and continue on with my life? Or is alcohol something I can‚Äôt have? I‚Äôm sorry this is so long. If anyone ends up reading this whole thing, thank you so so so much. I just need some advice. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself and I feel insanely guilty.",18,0

I'm always told 'youre helping me more than I'm helping you' 'you just energized me' I noticed they like to talk at you look me almost dump on you..So..

 Are recovered alcoholics like depending on a neverending supply of 'newcomers'? I know the higher power is supposed to provide the 'power'..butbwhat about people that don't believe in an almighty power and instead use the 'group' as their power.. literally. Like the program, I've heard has a dismal success rate, so most of the these newcomers won't get long term sobriety. This would mean they actually don't want everyone to recover almost like a pyramid scheme? Explains why they seem so cliquey and insular sometimes (or could be the high turnover rate guards are up)Does this like core group of sometimes cliquey recoverd alcoholics need these newcomers to like feed off their energy to maintain sobriety? Kind of like the new season of AHS? Except it's sobriety to maintain and not talent..
I haven't experienced this give at all meetings just some like insular clubhouses mainly..As a newcomer I sometimes left feeling a.overwhelmed from getting bombarded and b.sort of emotionally drained instead of feeling uplifted like I do at meetings not like what I describe..

I've become totally and completely unrecognisable. People were kind to me and I used them, either for company or for alcohol. I was so scared of being alone that it cost me my relationship. The irony being that I never really was alone.   


The things I've done and how I have behaved to people in the last 5 years disgusts me. I know who I am at my core and that isn't it, I can't figure out why I would do so many terrible things to those around me who cared. It crept up on me and now it's like the world is a blur and I'm being passed by without really getting to live a life.   


I lost the love of my life because I simply could not stop, the compulsion was overpowering. I struggle with depression and I honestly never thought I could feel this low. I guess I am at the hopeless feeling that spurs on so many to finally quit, I really hope it works for me too.

I'm 31 and felt like I've struggled with alcohol for almost 10 years. I've been able to function for the most part. Successful job, relationship, good friends. But often have drunk alone, felt like I wanted to drink more or quicker than the people around me and always would sneak drinks or deliberatelyom pour myself stronger ones. I've not had any serious repercussions other than some severe hangovers and embarrassment.

Over the last 5years I've quit 3 times and before that I couldn't remember a time I'd gone longer than 1 week without drinking since I was 18. The last time I quit was because I drank like I had a death wish or something. Its hard to explain but although it was a weeknight and I knew I would feel horrible the next day I just kept drinking. Low and behold I woke up at 3am with terrible anxiety and after a hellish day or so recovering I stopped.

I didn't stop thinking 'I'm an alcoholic' and I didnt attend AA or anything.

Long story short, my partner went on a business trip this week and I found myself thinking I could go and buy some alcohol and get drunk while he's away and I've been thinking recently, maybe now I've gone so long without alcohol I could try it again. The problem is the last couple of times I've done that I just slip back into the bad habits and eventually my body and mind can't handle it anymore.

I don't want to label myself an alcoholic because I don't know if I really am. If I can go so long without drinking and could do it without AA or rehab, maybe I'm just over exaggerating.

The amends is an opportunity for us to give to those from whom we have taken, for their sake! We come to this program powerless, meaning we had been relying on the delusion of personal power that we don't really have. No matter how hard we tried to exert personal power to manage our lives, we always ended up in the same place -- desperate and drunk with a path of wreckage behind us.

When we work this program of recovery with diligence, we get connected (or reconnected) to a higher power that fills us up and guides us, if we let it.

Hi everyone. I wanted to create this account and join this community to connect with others on the same journey as myself. Sorry that it‚Äôs kind of long. 
        I‚Äôve been struggling with alcohol addiction for the better part of 15 years. I‚Äôm 30 now. It originally started as a way to cope with being bullied in school, body shaming, childhood trauma, physical/mental abuse at home and from a teacher, rape, being taken by DCYF due to skipping school, and just never quite fitting in no matter how hard I tried. I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I ended up staying back in school for two years and dropped out in the 8th grade as soon as I turned 16. I kept most of these issues bottled up and picked up smoking cigarettes, self harm, drinking and smoking pot with my few friends who were also ‚Äúoutcasts.‚Äù I finally felt like I belonged since we all did the same thing to numb the pain.  
       When I turned 17, I got a fake ID and started dancing to make enough to move out of my abusive home. I got my own place and thought I was queen of the world. Well, unfortunately that job just glorified drinking and drugging and sent me down an even worse path. I stopped self harm and smoking pot/cigarette but the drinking got much worse as it was just handed to me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd pound down shots and put myself in risky situations.. But the money was incredible and since all my peers were doing it and my employer encouraged it, I felt like I belonged. I knew it was getting into a problem when even they fired me for getting too drunk‚Ä¶ I lost friends who were ‚Äúparty people‚Äù themselves. Cause I just couldn‚Äôt hold my liquor cause I was all or nothing. Having an eating disorder while drinking probably didn‚Äôt help. 
Anyways, this went on for years. I traveled to get away and any time anyone called me out on being a sloppy drunk, I got defensive and figured they were the problem. I felt like the whole world was against me. That they were the problem. When in reality, if you think everyone around you has a problem, you‚Äôre more than likely THE problem yourself. The only people I clicked with were those who would enable me and laugh when I got drunk but still hang out again. The ones who wouldn‚Äôt judge me and would feed my addiction.
I got so bad that I‚Äôd go out on dates just so someone could buy me drinks and get me drunk‚Ä¶ Even if I just ‚ÄúIrish goodbyed‚Äù them after.  I‚Äôve been hospitalized many times from passing out at bars or in public.. But I wouldn‚Äôt say it was cause I got drunk. I‚Äôd insist that I didn‚Äôt drink that much and that somebody must‚Äôve drugged my drink. I lied despite knowing the truth even when I was pronounced dead for 20 seconds. 
Nothing stopped me‚Ä¶ I thought I was so sly hiding bottles, burying cans under the trash so it would look like I drank less. Thinking I was holding my composure when I was a drunken mess‚Ä¶ 
After all of this, I still never thought my problem was a problem. Last year I attended my first AA meeting. But I compared instead of identified. I didn‚Äôt take it seriously and despite staying sober for 2 months, as soon as my bday came around I thought I was cured and that I can just have one or two and be fine. What a joke that was. Sure the first few times I was able to but then I was like well if I can have two then I can probably have 3 and be fine too. Ha. 
It got worse and worse. I denied having a problem cause it wasn‚Äôt daily. I‚Äôd just binge about twice per week. My poor fianc√© would come home from work and see me a drunken mess. 
But something hit me and hit me hard like a ton of bricks about a week ago. If I don‚Äôt get help, I‚Äôm going to die alone. He‚Äôs going to leave me. I‚Äôll be stuck in this toxic cycle. And I cried for days thinking about it. Almost got suicidal. But then something told me I can‚Äôt give up. I can‚Äôt lose faith. That I am a great person when I don‚Äôt abuse alcohol. That I need help. 
That is when I swore on everything that I WILL (not just try) quit. I want to feel alive and have a purpose. I want a bright future. To have a family. A happy home. Instead of building a life like the one I grew up with and around. I deserve better. My family deserves better (even if they tried to enable me), and my fianc√© deserves better. 
I‚Äôve been attending zoom meets daily as well as in person meets. I met a friend at AA who takes me to live meetings daily and is as eager about sobriety and helps encourage me. I try to speak at every meeting to get over the mental block and thought that I NEED alcohol for people to accept me and to talk to others. I got two chips that I carry everywhere as a reminder. I quit my bar tending job to avoid sabotage, keep a journal that I write in twice per day, I keep positive messages around the house, meditate and have been practicing mindfulness. I even went out with a group of people from AA to dinner yesterday. For the first time, the voice in the back of my head that tells me to drink was nowhere to be found. It was amazing. To be able to smile, laugh, talk freely and be myself without using alcohol as a crutch like I did for 15 years‚Ä¶.. I know it‚Äôs just the beginning but I feel blessed.. I feel like I‚Äôm on a path to finally break free from everything I once knew. I‚Äôll finally be able to grow and create a beautiful life‚Ä¶. 

If you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read my story. Sharing this so openly was tough but I feel relieved and maybe my story will help someone else. Recovery is possible. Whether you are on day 1 or year 10, you got this and are doing amazing. Thank you.",29,0

I'm particularly triggered lately because I'm thinking I need to rehome my dog. Every time I have gone to rehab, the hospital, or left town to help dying family, I have no one who can take proper care of him and I don't really know any services that are trustworthy. 

I get confused, frustrated, scared and sad whenever I think about anything like getting a job, having an apartment of my own, or trying to keep the program first.  I get depressive and anxious, meds take away most of my ability to enjoy my life, and I just don't want to live in this shitty circumstance anymore.  I haven't attempted suicide in a long time, which I guess is progress, but I have relapsed a couple times trying to get back into the program because I can't think about anything other than not wanting to deal with life.

My AA home group are awesome, I love them and they love me, but when any pressure comes my way and I become anxious or depressive, they are quick to point me towards therapy.  Therapy really doesn't seem to be helpful at all. I can't help but think that I'm just lying to myself about the success of the program. I just feel like pretending I'm alright, having some small victories that make other people think I'm better, and ignoring everything I feel and think to just outsource my purpose is all I'm doing.  Where is the happy joyous and free life I've been promised? How does it slip away so frequently?

I‚Äôm a 26 year old woman and just had my first child in May. I remained sober my entire pregnancy for my son‚Äôs health but since giving birth, I‚Äôve fallen right back into regular drinking. I‚Äôm a highly functional drunk, I‚Äôm capable of doing everything normally, speaking normally, and I never allow myself to breastfeed after more than the recommended limit of 1-2 glasses of wine. But once I breastfeed, I down a few more drinks to make the most of that time before I have to sober up again. (I do not endanger my son‚Ä¶ for the most part, we bottle feed him). 

A few important notes: 

I and my husband both were raised by alcoholic mothers. I cared for my mother in my teenage years while she scream-cried for hours and pulled knives on me, slurred and stumbled, etc. My father gave up helping her, they separated and I was her caretaker. Then it was my baby brother when I left. She considers herself ‚Äúwell‚Äù now. And while she is happy and I enjoy being around her again, she very much is still a heavy drinker. 

I have attempted to quit before and I always manage to justify not continuing my streak. Usually it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only drink on the weekends‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drink as much water as alcohol‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only drink the seven drinks max limit‚Äù, etc. 

I am on heavy-ish medication. An anti-anxiety, an anti-depressant, and a beta blocker. 

I ALWAYS end up hating myself in the midst of drinking. Every. Fucking. Time. I get so pissed that I let myself drink as much as I did. Then once the headache goes away and I sleep it off, I manage to justify it all over again the next night. 

I saw a therapist for 5 years and she repeatedly told me she did not believe I had a problem, even though I regularly brought it up. She thinks I only feel out of control because I‚Äôm so scared to become my mother. 

But I never want to put my son through what I went through. I want to live a long, healthy life. Frankly, I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôve somehow already fucked up my body.

Throughout this time I began to find structure in my life, an inner peace began to develop and a stability I‚Äôd never encountered before while drinking. Passion for hobbies began to resurface. The feeling I chased in a bottle became the promise granted by sobriety. Heaven on earth wouldn‚Äôt be the way to describe sobriety; but even though the days felt longer and the temptation remained, it was worth it one hundred percent. 

When I relapsed, drinking felt different. I found that in comparison to the joy I found in daily life sober, the joy I found in strengthening relationships and putting my all into my work; being drunk just felt tiring. The feeling alcohol gave me felt synthetic, dulling my emotions and range of expression. Not to mention that afterwards I had nothing to show for it apart from an aching body and a looming cloud of depression.

I‚Äôm back on the bandwagon thankfully, going to meetings and taking it one day at a time. Though I will say this relapse was a huge reminder and positive affirmation, of why alcohol will be the devil I choose not to dance with. It pales in comparison to choosing life.",70,0

Hey everyone, I'm an alcoholic. 

I've been sober for a little over 3 years, have not been to an AA meeting since picking up my one year coin. Did my 90 in 90 to start off and walked through the 12 steps with a sponsor, over my first year in AA. Let me start by saying AA and my sponsor ABSOLUTELY saved my life. I still make a weekly gratitude list, still meditate, still journal daily, and still keep in touch with many others in my home group. 

I left due to absolutely loathing the idea of giving it up to a higher power. I know I'm a cliche, just an atheist struggling with the concept like many others I suppose. If you've read into Bills past you'll know he's ran into similar situations and also medically took LSD in therapy, and he accredited it to rejuvenating his spirituality. 

I would like to use the psychedelics as a way to explore my own spirituality.  I've volunteered at John's Hopkins for studies, this would be something I would like to do with professionals as I've never done it before. I was more of a blow and whiskey guy.

Basically the epitome of the ""if you had my life, you would drink like I drink "" syndrome. 

I had an alcoholic father that was the kind to tell my mother that if she left him, he'd kill all of us. So we ran around the country hiding during my childhood.  New schools every few months because he would find us, etc. I saw a lot of violence blah blah. So my mom tried her best to help me and had me seeing counselors really young. 

I learned right away these counselors show sympathy for you when you tell them things.  They told me I've seen too much. That im traumatized. That im different than normal healthy kids and im going to need ongoing treatment, likely forever. As I grew up, I was diagnosed with more and more. PTSD, bi-polar disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and panic attacks. They even told me that I had a chemical imbalance. That i lacked the natural ""feel good"" chemicals normal people have... And I was prescribed more and more. 

People with fancy degrees assuring me that I have valid medical and psychological issues requiring chemical treatment. Shit... Thats all you had to say!

Of course if I have to be medicated to live through all my mental issues and chemical imbalances, I may as well be the one to choose which meds make me feel better. The ones they prescribed really never did much for me. After much experimentation, I settled on liquor being the most effective chemical solution.  It was the only thing that worked AND it was all natural, legal, easy to get, and didn't require a prescription and dependence on the medical industrial complex. Win-win.

Then I drank to a point of dependency where when they separated me from liquor, I had a seizure, respiratory failure, delirium tremens, and had to use a walker to learn to walk again.  Liquor quit working and I was out of options. The plan was to go to AA a bit to show my family that I at least tried something before drinking myself to death.

A little over a year sober and I recently got to step 12 with my sponsor. I finally got honest. Im not crazy. Im just a drunk! I don't have PTSD, just been through a bit more drama than some.  Drama, not trauma!  I needed a spiritual solution, not a chemical solution this whole time.

At 5am I finally searched for AA meetings near me. I‚Äôm super sporadic and chaotic when I‚Äôm drinking so I left the house even though it didn‚Äôt start for another 2 and a half hours. I hit the gas station and bought a tall boy. Turns out the meeting didn‚Äôt start until 9am. To kill time I went to my sister-in-law‚Äôs place and helped her take her son to school. Thank GOD she was awake. She actually ended up going to the meeting with me! When we got there it was exactly what I remembered from when I was 13 in rehab being forced to attend AA. A bunch of old geezers who all knew each other‚Ä¶ but this time I was there by choice and everyone was soooo kind and welcoming. Meeting one of the women was really special for me. In minutes of meeting each other she was hugging me and I just broke down in tears. I guess because I felt hopeful for once. I know the meetings alone do not keep you sober but for once I finally felt like I had the ability to let go of this chain on my life. Everyone at that meeting this morning read passages that stuck with both my sister in law and me. They didn‚Äôt urge us to think of recovery with God in a religious way and that‚Äôs great because we‚Äôre very spiritual in a different way. I was white faced, emotional, hadn‚Äôt slept in 24 hours, drunk as piss, head throbbing, and I look over at my sister and see her wiping tears and knew that we were both meant to be there today.

I'm 20, part of me feels like it's pathetic that at 20 years old I'm already one year sober. That at so young I had a problem and had to choose sobriety if I wanted to survive. In September of 2020 I got black out drunk and fought cops, that was my rock bottom. I knew something had to change. From the second I turned 18 to that point at 19 I was essentially drunk every night. If I couldn't hide the night drinking I'd day drink and walk around. I functioned. I could function, but without the promise of alcohol I felt there was no reason to live. When I hit my rock bottom I met a paramedic who changed my life and perspective on things. He showed me there was more to life then getting shit faced. I had my last hoorah on October 5, 2020, of course it was day drinking. Well morning drinking. I got plastered on the steps of the courthouse. I'm missing most of that day, but I remember sobering up at McDonald's. At roughly 5:45pm I was sober. I promised myself when I started drinking that day to only have enough to enjoy. That's the last time I got drunk or even had a drop of alcohol. It's 6:30pm October 5, 2021 and I am proud to say I am 1 year sober. One whole year sober. I'll be honest I didn't think it was possible. It still scares me, what if I relapse after getting this far? What if I fail everyone? It's scary, but at least I can say is that in this moment I did it. Now I KNOW I can do it. I hope I don't slip, but it's one day at a time.

What a freedom I felt when this passage was pointed out to me!  Suddenly I saw that I could do something about my anger, I could fix me, instead of trying to fix them.  I believe that there are no exceptions to the axiom.  When I am angry, my anger is always self-centered.  I must keep reminding myself that I am human, that I am doing the best I can, even when that best is sometimes poor.  So I ask God to remove my anger and truly set me free.

I was told to go to meetings, get a sponsor, work the steps, help others, get involved, among other things.

Since coming back to AA God has done marvelous things in my life. If you don't believe in God we can call it ""Me getting out of the way"". My life is full. I am a loving man. I am useful. If your life is dark and you feel hopeless I plead that you really give AA a shot. Not just an AA sub on reddit, or checking out some zoom meetings- get involved. Get a sponsor, set out chairs, help clean up, give people rides to the meeting, call people, chair meetings, get a home group, get plugged in. 

&#x200B;

I alone am not responsible for these changes....my own experience proved that time and time again. This part of the book is one of the first things I read with my sponsor. He told me I had to stop with the belligerence (fighting to stay sick ""yeah, buts...) and demonstrate some willingness (I was taught that willingness is action. I wanted A LOT of things in my life, but what actions did I actually take to get them?)

&#x200B;

My actual sobriety date is Oct 13. I went to a friends wedding on Oct12 knowing full well I was going to drink. But I also knew the end was near. I was circling the drain. I was beaten down. It was the most miserable night of drinking. I drank not because I wanted to, but because I HAD to. There was no choice. I drank full well knowing that I was done, it was a very strange feeling. The next day I went to a meeting and that's when things began to change. Oh how dark it is before the dawn indeed!

**From The Spiritual Experience:**

**Most of us think this awareness of a Power greater than ourselves is the essence of spiritual experience. Our more religious members call it ""God-consciousness.""**

**Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual principles. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.**

**We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program. WILLINGNESS, HONESTY AND OPEN MINDEDNESS ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF RECOVERY. BUT THESE ARE INDISPENSABLE.**

Staying sober the first couple of years is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done.  It took lots of meetings, sometimes 3 a day, a good sponsor, and working the steps.  I also had to cut things out of my life that made me want to drink.  

I am not a an ideal example of how to work the program.  Sometimes I‚Äôve been an example of what not to do.  I‚Äôm glad the program allows for imperfection, as long as we are honest and rigorous.

These days, not drinking is my habit.  Cravings, once always present, are almost nonexistent now, and if they do arise, are easy to dismiss.  However, I never want to let my guard down or forget where I came from.  It was a horrible place, and I never want to return.

I say all this to let you know that if you embrace the program with honesty and a willingness to work, not only is sobriety possible, it can get easier the longer you stick with the program.

He vocalized that he thought our group should rethink closing the meeting with the Lords Prayer. He said that it‚Äôs a Christian prayer and has the potential to alienate new comers who might not share that particular faith. I, as a non Christian agree with him 100% although I did not vocalize it at the time. I never recite the Lords Prayer even though my home group closes with it every week. It‚Äôs a Catholic prayer and I personally find the Catholic Church to be a corrupt and questionable institution. I wouldn‚Äôt  never try and steer someone away from their faith as I believe it is a deeply personal choice. But I agree that AA prayers should be non denominational. The old timer who brought this up was very polite and provided examples of alternatives that are in the big book. The next day I attended another meeting and over heard a group of men saying some pretty vicious things about this guy for merely making a suggestion.

Life had gotten hard and I wanted to die. I knew what would make that feeling go away -- a drink. The compulsion came back in a hurry. Half a beer later, and I wanted to quit my job, move to NYC, get whatever work I could, and drink myself to death.

Fortunately, that was just one night and when I sobered up, I realized that I needed to get honest with myself and with this program. See, I'm one of those people that doesn't ever want to be ""the class fuckup"". I was like, if I'm going to be an alcoholic, I'm going to be the best damn alcoholic in AA. I got a sponsor. I did 30 in 30. I worked the steps. I took all kinds of service positions. But, I wasn't being honest with myself and when life got hard, as it does, I picked up a drink.

The second time around, I got a new sponsor. I made a searching and fearless moral inventory. I stopped trying to be a ""good alcoholic"" and got honest with myself and those around me. Part of that was 30 days of raising my hand as a newcomer and then picking up a 30 day chip. That was 22 years ago today.

Since then, both my parents have died. I got married, divorced, and married again. I got laid off, quit jobs, got promoted, got told I ""wasn't meeting expectations"", moved, etc...

How do I maintain my spiritual condition?  For me it's quite simple: on a daily basis I ask my Higher Power to grant me the gift of sobriety for that day!  I have talked to many alcoholics who have gone back to drinking and I always ask them: 'Did you pray for sobriety the day you took your first drink?'  Not one of them said yes.  As I practice Step Ten and try to keep my house in order on a daily basis, I have the knowledge that if I ask for a daily reprieve, it will be granted.

How come you don't drink anymore? 

""How come you don't drink anymore?"" a renewed acquaintance from long ago asked the other day.
""Anymore than who?, I asked.
""I mean any longer. How come you don't drink anything these days?""
""Drink? I drink...coffee, milk, juice, tea, soda pop, water...""

""I mean drink"" he said. "" you know, booze.""
""Oh, booze, No I don't drink booze any more, you're right,"" I said, I couldn't' trust it anymore. It turned on me. Once my friend, it became my enemy.""

""Maybe you got a bad batch."" he said.

""No the sauce is the same. I changed. Because I have this illness of alcoholism, my tolerance weakened. Alcoholism doesn't come in bottles, it comes in people.""

""Sounds pretty confusing"" the fellow said

""You think you're confused,"" I said, ""You should have seen me. I drank for happiness and became unhappy... I drank for joy and became miserable... I drank to be outgoing and became self centered... I drank for sociability and became argumentative and lonely."" I drank for sophistication and became rude and obnoxious...I drank for friendship and made enemies... I drank to soften sorrow and wallowed in self pity... I drank for sleep and awakened without rest.

I drank for strength and felt weak.. I drank medicinally and got sick.. I drank because I thought my job called for it and I lost my job.. I drank for relaxation and got the shakes.. I drank for confidence and became uncertain.. I drank for courage and became afraid.. I drank for assurance and became doubtful... I drank to stimulate thought and blacked out... I drank to make conversation and it tied my tongue... I drank for warmth and lost my cool. I drank for coolness and lost my warmth... I drank to feel heaven and came to know hell. I drank to forget and became haunted. I drank for freedom and became a slave...I drank to erase problems and saw them multiply... I drank to cope with life and invited death ..or worse... I drank because I had the right and everything turned out wrong..

""Gosh!"" My friend exclaimed, ""That must have taken a bunch of booze to get you in that shape. 
""Just one"" I told him, ""The first one. For me one is too many, and a thousand is not enough.""

So yeah, I got sober 6 years ago. Life was pretty sucky. Life was miserable. I had a ready made family that loved me, and supported me.  I had everything I ever wanted. A loyal and great woman, 2 daughters and a son. I had everything but the nice car, house, picket fence, and dog. But still drugs were all I gave a shit about. I mean, I cared and loved my family, sure.  But I loved the feelings drugs produced more. Then one day, drugs stopped producing those feelings that I loved. And suddenly, I could no longer deal with the world and the chaos I created. I knew how to be clean but didn‚Äôt know how to be sober. Didn‚Äôt know how to live life on life‚Äôs terms. My fix was no longer fixing a goddamn thing, in fact my fix was making things exponentially worse.  It‚Äôs a tricky spot to be in when you‚Äôre sick of living but too scared to die.  Suicide was contemplated, attempted, and failed. 

That day I failed for the last time and gave in to the notion that I had a problem, needed help, wanted help, and would succeed or die trying to get better. 6 years later I‚Äôm recovered. I have my off days sure, anxiety, depression, commitment problems, disdain for authority, still love starting chaos, saying things when I should bite my tongue, saying things incorrectly without regards to others feelings, posting shitty memes, and starting facebook dumpster fires. I‚Äôm not perfect. But now a days, I don‚Äôt really enjoy being the center of attention, I actually get anxious over it (no one who remembers the old me would ever believe that!).  Nowadays, I do have the nice car, the house, the picket fence, 2 cats and a dog!! It‚Äôs wild to me. 

Today was a huge day for me and my son. But in typical selfish me form, I‚Äôm concentrating on why it was so huge to me‚Ä¶Since little Pete was born I always wanted to take him to a NFL football game. And do all that cool shit you see other Dads doing with their kids on TV and in Movies. ALWAYS. But it always seemed like a pipe dream to me during my days of active addiction. Then I got clean and in my mind I made mental notes, a check list of sorts, of things I wanted to accomplish or at least try to accomplish.  I‚Äôve checked off a TON. And today was another one of them. Today was super special to me and I hope to my son too. We were gifted an opportunity from a random stranger to make this memory. And after the game on our drive home there was a homeless guy asking for money‚Ä¶me and Pete gave him a few bucks. I asked Pete if he knew why? He said ‚ÄúYou do good things so you get good things in return‚Äù. And I smiled and said ‚ÄúYes and no, dude.  We‚Äôre supposed to pay it forward and do good things without expectation of anything in return.  We had a blast today because someone did something nice for us and didn‚Äôt want anything in return, so we pay it forward like Lindsey would always tell us to do‚Äù. Pete looked at me and said ‚ÄúAhhh I got ya, but he did want you to do something in return‚Ä¶he wanted you to take that video with him and send him pictures.‚Äù  I smiled and was like ‚ÄúDamn, touch√©‚Äù the kid is wise beyond his years, because even though we say we do good things for others without any expectation of anything in return and try to practice altruism‚Ä¶ultimately it is for some self-serving purpose no matter how minute it may be. For me, my self-serving purpose is to continue to be blessed enough to make these kind of memories with my family. Best part about being sober is there is no ‚Äúset‚Äù check list, it‚Äôs all tentative‚Ä¶we just keep adding to the list day by day. Thanks Lindsey, miss ya.

This isn‚Äôt to diminish the things I‚Äôve done with each of my daughters. We have our memories too. Individual and as a family unit. I hope when they see this they don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt love them or not proud of them. Trust me ladies, we‚Äôve checked off many on my list too! Proud of all my kids.",16,0

Wasn't ready until I was ready and now I'm ready. Some of us get to be in the 'sometimes slowly' category. The important thing is that it works - especially when you work it. It's not like I've been sitting around doing nothing while not drinking. Been doing lots of other practices - breathwork, meditation, yoga, sauna, cold water immersion, intense daily journaling, connecting with what I now consider my higher power - and during Covid I had the luxury of being able to spend almost all of last year in the woods/fishing/camping/exploring all the local places that are normally overrun with tourists (Alaska). Oh, and being of service chairing/hosting a weekly online Zoom meeting with my wife (20 years in the program). All of which set me up mentally/emotionally/spiritually, to now do the work of the steps for real. Which was good because when I caught Covid last month, it hit me hard (grateful for the vaccine - suspect I'd have died otherwise), and I came out of it with the worst depression I've had in years. I wallowed until my - much wiser - wife suggested I go back to basics and work the first three steps. Got myself a brand-new-old-school sponsor, and I've been working the program harder than anything I've worked at before. Not just half-stepping and playing lip service to it, but committing to it completely. Hey, got news for you folks that are on the fence - IT WORKS! After writing about 20 pages in step 4 (didn't know I had that much resentment!), I've started step 5 and looking forward to the rest of it. Have had just a hint of a taste of the comprehension of the word serenity, and I've even had a few precious moments of genuine peace.

I‚Äôve had a few coffee dates with women and they went ok but I‚Äôm so crippled by social anxiety that I‚Äôm generally a little quiet, hard to get to know, and honestly probably boring until you get over this VERY large hurdle of getting to know sober me. I‚Äôm dying inside because I have so much I want to say (until I‚Äôm socializing and then I freeze up and have no thoughts to contribute) and I think I could be a great friend but am so awkward at first. 

What do sober women DO together? I think if we had something to do (other than just talk‚Äî a terrifying prospect) it could help. 

Any advice or support would be appreciated. I‚Äôm feeling a little raw and emotional and sad about my stunted social skills and loneliness. As a kid I felt so alone it would be suffocating. The feelings are coming back again",17,0

I‚Äôve gone to a meeting everyday for those four days. I‚Äôve confided in a friend, my brother & my partner that I‚Äôm struggling and need help‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm struggling deeply with really *believing* the first step‚Ä¶that I‚Äôm powerless over alcohol.

Even though I know exactly what I did 4 days ago that got me to this point. And I know what happened two weeks before that and a week before that. I thought I had drinking under control and honestly hidden, suppressed and avoided all the wreckage that was headed my way pre-pandemic. The pandemic oddly provided a respite. I replaced drinking heavily with weed and food and sometimes even just happy joyful moments with friends. But lately the stressors have started to pick up the pace and so again has my drinking. The time between huge fuck ups has decreased and the magnitude of the fuck ups has increased at such an astonishingly fast rate. 

And yet I walked into the meeting today feeling like a fraud‚Ä¶.like I‚Äôm just being dramatic and want attention and that‚Äôs why I was in that meeting. I couldn‚Äôt say I was an alcoholic out loud. I think that there is a chance I might not be an alcoholic because I don‚Äôt drink every day. I still have a great job and a car and a good credit score. I feel like a fraud being in that room and then simultaneously feel like a fraud outside of the room because I can‚Äôt admit out loud all the fucked up shit I‚Äôve done while drinking.

I just want to forget what I‚Äôve done and move on. I know the people I‚Äôve told will probably give me a pass. But those same people I‚Äôve hurt the most and will definitely lose if I keep fucking up like this.

I don‚Äôt even know what the point of this post is. Just needed to get this out because my brain feels like it‚Äôs in a fog and moving too fast at once. I just want relief.",23,0

There was an unexpected amount of negative, judgemental comments that seemed to come from a self-righteous standpoint.  To those who chose to be rude, it's eye opening to realize that perhaps the attitude I ran into when calling and seeking out meetings is commonplace within AA... this was unfortunate to discover today. Y'all need to maybe reassess how you approach people who are also seeking help.  Anyways, thanks to those who did help me out.




ORIGINAL: I've called to find a meeting in my area and they start asking all sorts of personal questions (name, sex, age, drug of choice...etc??).... that has really made me never ever go and pursue it more than calling. 

I call and just end up hanging up because why would I tell see stranger on the phone personal things about me when all I want is a location for an AA meeting to attend?  

These probing questions by some stranger on a phone kinda defeats the whole purpose of AA... and when I ask why they are asking me all these personal questions and that it makes me uncomfortable, they get rude and angry with me... definitely not encouraging for people who are seeking help for an issue.

I really need some advice from people who are more knowledgeable. What should I do? It's way too late to make a separate dessert at this point, should I just inform the person privately and let them make their own decision? Maybe I can text his gf and ask what desserts he likes, and go out and buy something else? 

Is it okay to eat foods cooked with alcohol if the flavor of the dish is not affected at all? From my research, it seems that in a blind baked crust like this, there would only be 1/4 tsp alcohol left in the entire pie at the end of the process, at most.  

I feel like a jerk for overlooking this, but what's done is done, and I just want to handle it correctly from this point. I feel pretty uncomfortable asking him directly because I hardly know the guy, but if that's what I have to do, I'll do it.

When I was new, on my very second day of sobriety, a particular group at a particular meeting was going out to eat for fellowship afterward. I had raised my hand for a sponsor and a few remembered I had gotten my 24 hour chip at another meeting the day before, so lots of them stopped to talk to me afterwards and told me I should definitely go. It was very friendly and kind and I was willing to do anything in the beginning so I went.

Being there was a different story. A few talked to me for a moment at the beginning, but that conversation quickly fizzled out and everyone naturally segregated into their own smaller groups of their pre-existing friends. I tried chiming in a few more times but struggled to actually get into a conversation of any length. This one bit** right next to me said ONE WORD every time I talked to her until I gave up. Hate her to this day. They all just talked about people/ things that they knew and I didn‚Äôt. I tried my best to stay open and calm (as opposed to socially anxious) and I did not take out my phone. Overall, I did not like this experience. 

I don‚Äôt claim to be some amazing conversationalist, so I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs even all their fault. But I felt stupid for agreeing to go to fellowship when no one really wanted to talk to me, even when I was a raw 48 hours sober. And forget about now that I‚Äôm 2 months and not new anymore. I WOULD absolutely go to fellowship with my home group, or if a friend I knew was already there. But the whole ‚Äúdefinitely go!!!‚Äù thing is bullshit.

2691,Wife‚Äôs Drinking,13,qgfptw,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/qgfptw/wifes_drinking/,59,1635280892.0,"Not sure who else to talk to so here goes:

My wife and I are looking at having kids in the next 6 months or so, but I‚Äôm really concerned about her relationship with alcohol. I‚Äôve ‚Äúwalked in on‚Äù her in the kitchen a few times, just super drunk out of nowhere. Like, glassy eyes, swaying for balance, can‚Äôt get coherent words out drunk. Which in itself is annoying, but not a total deal breaker since there‚Äôs a lot about her that I love really deeply. But still, I find her unattractive when she‚Äôs in that state. 

What worries me is when I‚Äôll ask her about it, she‚Äôll say she didn‚Äôt drink anything. Also, I never actually see her drink, so I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs hiding it. Which isn‚Äôt a good sign. 

Still, the evidence is there. All the once-full bottles in the liquor cabinet are empty, and I haven‚Äôt been drinking anything over the last few months. Plus, there are some half empty fifths in the garage that I don‚Äôt remember getting. So clearly someone in the house is drinking, and it‚Äôs not me. Just the two of us live here. 

So I think she‚Äôs drinking in secret, and drinking a lot at times. Still, it‚Äôs not a daily occurrence. 

Where I worry is that she totally denies this, and denies the idea that she might have a problem drinking (I‚Äôve learned not to bring this up), and she is totally confident she won‚Äôt drink during pregnancy or with small children around. But I‚Äôve learned I can‚Äôt believe anything she says or promises about her drinking. So I don‚Äôt know what to do here. 

Basically, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll end up watching my wife hurt herself and our future child with her drinking, but at that point it will be too late to avoid this scenario. I don‚Äôt know how to discuss it with her. Since we‚Äôre both 30 I feel like there‚Äôs a little bit of a ticking clock here in terms of addressing her drinking and starting a family. But ultimately, I would rather have kids safely without her than with her if she doesn‚Äôt/won‚Äôt acknowledge this issue. 

She has a lot of trauma from her mom‚Äôs drinking when she was a kid (dad‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic too but hasn‚Äôt drank in 28 years). She HATES the idea of therapy and says, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how I process things.‚Äù But she gets weirdly emotional when talking about family stuff so I feel like she hasn‚Äôt so much ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù as ‚Äúrepressed‚Äù these issues. I think she has some self-worth/self-love issues around this, that aren‚Äôt getting better with age. 

As I understand it, direct confrontation isn‚Äôt the way to deal with alcoholism because the sense of shame just leads to more drinking. So really any advice on any of this would be good. Fuuuck, I‚Äôm stressed.

Edit: Thank you for your help and good wishes. I guess r/Al-Anon is probably the better forum for this, but I appreciate all of your perspectives, and patience with me. It's given me some good things to think about, and has helped me trust my judgement more. My wife is in pain, that's clear. Wish you all the best.",13,0

On a positive note, I didn't get drunk nor did I have a hang over. Usually I over do it and sleep on the floor in the rest room. I consider this a small victory. I didn't lose complete control, I didn't drink and drive, nor did I go back to get more. I've been trying for a while to stop, the most I was going was 5 days or less with out whiskey. I'm proud of those 21 days. Here are some things that I noticed about being sober.

- I saved a lot of money in October, around $500, maybe more. I smoke more cigarettes when I'm drunk, and then instead of cooking for my self a reasonable meal, I buy some fast food, which can be expensive, especially if I am drunk and getting it everyday. After a slew of drinks, I don't want to cook.

- I felt my brain was moving faster. My job felt easier, I could type faster. Other things as well, like I had more patience for problem solving.

- sober, I was a better person to be around. Family and friends told me as much, people that had no idea that I was 21 days sober, had mentioned that was just something about me that was different, in a good way.

- I had more time, to help my kids with their homework, accomplish little goals like yard work, cleaning out my garage, or other home improvement projects. Normally, being drunk, I wouldn't want to do anything. If I started drinking early enough, the day is pretty much over. I wouldn't accomplish anything. Getting stuff done made my house look great, which felt really good.

- I felt better, healthier then I have in a long time. My skin looks better too.

I'm not going to give up, if your reading this, you shouldn't either. We don't need alcohol to have fulfilling lives. I'm looking forward to all the things I will accomplish being sober. I can do this. You can too. Starting again today, I'm not going to drink.",35,0

I‚Äôm done enabling her shit, we went to the hospital earlier today for some serious health issues and the only thing wrong with her was what the alcohol was doing to her. 

I‚Äôve been awake for two days keeping an eye on her literally constantly, she hasn‚Äôt left my sight for two days. And before we went to the hospital she had a glass of wine and half a beer. When they tested her, her BAC came back as 0.4 (no, not a typo). From a single glass of wine and half a beer. 

The only thing the doctors said was that it was killing her, and it‚Äôs the only thing that is wrong. But the second we got home she was drinking again, and obviously we got into a fight about it. 

I want to help her, I want to be there for her. I‚Äôve had my own struggle with alcoholism, I know this isn‚Äôt an easy thing to do. But she‚Äôs choosing the beer over me, and it‚Äôs hurtful. 

When I tell her that she gets inconsolable. She won‚Äôt be sober long enough to have a conversation about this, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

Called on an AA friend, an accountant who had had some heart work done. He stopped whatever he was doing and got on the phone. Having good recovery, he thought nothing of putting my problem ahead of his work for the time being. For the same reason and having more clarity of thought than I, not being  threatened with the seemingly unsurmountable problem, he had some optimism and looked for facts to support it. His doctor suggested that I visit the medical education clinic of a particular good teaching hospital.  I did. I was accepted as a patient and treated like royalty as far as I was concerned. as it happened my resident had other business the day of my  angioplasty  with stent and one of the big guns with his name on the letterhead actually did the procedure. although I'm sure the intern would have done as good of job.

Years have passed and I started experiencing heart problems again. This time with Medicare and supplemental insurance I now pay for, I chose the same hospital, one for their excellent reputation and service and two to repay their generosity from years ago.

Truly I‚Äôm not an exemplary member. I just try to make progress. 

I am subscribed to several recovery subreddits and as I scroll I see posts with ‚ÄúI slipped‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI was sober for X and relapsed‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. in their titles. Today I saw the term ‚Äú‚Äòlapsed‚Äù used in a title. 

Recovery can include mistakes. People will use until they don‚Äôt or they die. That‚Äôs part of this thing. I find the careless use of these euphemisms to be a form of enabling and I can‚Äôt abide. If I drink, it won‚Äôt have been a slip, an oopsie, a relapse, a ‚Äòlapse. It will have been me drinking. I will have used. It will be a huge failure on my part as a person in recovery. 

If I drink, I die. 

No one has an ‚Äúoops. I died‚Äù moment. No one thinks ‚Äúwell that was millimeters from killing me violently, what should I do for lunch?‚Äù So why do we take using so lightly? Why is it ok to have a ‚Äòlapse and move on? Sure, I guess I‚Äôd be grateful if I drank tomorrow and didn‚Äôt manage to kill myself or someone else, but I wouldn‚Äôt dare say ‚Äúoopsie!‚Äù

Edit: Thank you for the replies and discussion. One reply asked, rhetorically, if we should shame those that do go out. Obviously, I speak of my recovery. I would not deign to shame anyone who wants to be in recovery. I simply think that letting ‚Äúslips‚Äù be part of my recovery process would‚Äôve damned me to failure.

E2: I learned about words!

E3: I‚Äôve learned a lot from this. I appreciate seeing the differing views, as well as having my hard line view tempered by newer science and individuality.

I've been watching Midnight Mass of Netflix. I won‚Äôt spoil any of it for anyone, though I do recommend giving it a watch. The writer/director is a big Stephen King fan, and it carries the same vibe, including a lot of King‚Äôs commentaries on addiction and recovery. AA plays a strong role in the series as well. 

There‚Äôs one scene in particular that stood out to me when watching it recently though, and it‚Äôs what reminds me of what small thing I‚Äôve done that has gotten me through the past year. The main character and another man have been holding impromptu AA meetings, just the two of them, in the basement of the town church. One night, the town drunk, having had enough misery in his life, becomes the third attendee at this meeting. When asked to provide some inspiration to the newcomer, the lead character tells him ‚ÄúYou showed up‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre here, and that‚Äôs enough. It won‚Äôt be enough forever, but for tonight it is. For tonight, it‚Äôs everything.‚Äù 

This caught me off guard in the middle of the third episode of a horror/thriller TV series. For a while now (I‚Äôd say for about nine or ten months) I have been doing written retirement. It‚Äôs a daily reflection/inventory/journal of sorts. One of the things that I added to my retirement after getting out of treatment was a question that isn‚Äôt in the book:

What has my sobriety asked of me today?

For about six months now I‚Äôve been tracking the things, big and small, that I‚Äôve had to step outside of my norm for in order to maintain my spiritual health. I did this because, and I imagine some here might be able to relate, I catastrophize. Before even approaching a problem, I assume the worst in terms of the lengths I will have to go to resolve it. I‚Äôll give an example. 

When I was getting out of treatment, I was faced with the task of living in South Carolina and working with the State of Virginia (sorry, Commonwealth of Virginia) to get my license back after my 2019 DUI. In my head, I started tabulating what I thought it would take to get through the process. If you had asked me in the moment, it was too great a feat, too great an expense, than I could ever manage. All this, disregarding the fact that plenty of other people resolve their DUIs every year. *My* situation was beyond the pale. But when it came down to it, what I *actually* had to do was pay my fines, attend my improvement classes, fill out some paperwork to reapply, and go to the DMV. That‚Äôs it. What the situation demanded of me was a small amount of effort, a little bit of money, and some patience. In other words, what I *thought* it was going to ask of me and what it *actually* cost me were dramatically different. And this is often true in my sobriety as well.

When I stepped into the program, my head went immediately to calculating all the things I would have to give up, all of the things I‚Äôd have to forfeit, all the compromises I‚Äôd have to make, in order to get and stay sober. And in that moment at the start, the price tag I had in my head was too high. But I was lucky enough to have someone tell me something like what the show‚Äôs character did. That in that moment, I expressed a willingness to stop, and took a small action to back it up. And, *in that moment*, it was enough. It was everything.

In the year since, my sobriety has asked more of me than just being willing and showing up. What was enough at the start is not enough today, but the price tags are far more reasonable than my neurotic, catastrophizing mind would have me believe. That‚Äôs where my written retirement comes into play. It lets me look back in moments where I‚Äôm having a rough time and really see what terms my Higher Power has set. And you know what I find?

I‚Äôve had to show some humility. I‚Äôve had to forgive when I don‚Äôt necessarily want to. I‚Äôve had to go to meetings when I wasn‚Äôt always in the mood. I do some paperwork to maintain a regular moral inventory. I spend some time every day in prayer. I spend some time every day in meditation. I make amends and ask for forgiveness. And the paradoxically hardest one of all: I sit down and find a way to be okay with just being okay and showing gratitude for the things that I have now that I would‚Äôve killed for a year ago.

*None* of these is a burdensome request, especially considering everything I used to demand from the world around me when I was drinking. But I‚Äôm a neurotic fuck, so I need to be reminded that my life is damned good right now and the worst thing that could happen, if I‚Äôm being entirely honest with myself, is me being right about how I see the world. 

So to the newcomer: 

You‚Äôre here, and that‚Äôs enough. I can tell you from personal experience that it won‚Äôt always be enough, but for right now, for this moment, it‚Äôs everything.",38,0

It felt super cathartic when I was preparing for it and writing out my resentments and fears. I noticed that I surprisingly wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly emotional when writing it all out despite hitting on some hard realizations. I felt like a lot of weight was being lifted off of me while I was getting all of this sorted and becoming super aware of where my deep seated issues were existing. 

As soon as I sat down with my sponsor today though, I just immediately started crying. I cried so much from having to be so vulnerable and honest with another human instead of guarded and hiding behind sarcasm. I cried from all of the pain I had been carrying for so long. I cried from piecing together how my childhood trauma created coping mechanisms that became my character defects. I cried hard over how much my pain was put off on others. I hadn‚Äôt really let myself cry about this stuff until now.

I was expecting my fifth step to just be a super light and easy removal of all of this stuff (like how it felt when I was organizing it prior) and instead I‚Äôm feeling so deeply exhausted. It really felt like the most long winded therapy session. It was so humbling and humanizing. My sponsor was really supportive and made me feel totally accepted and validated.

I have been going to this one AA meeting for about one month now. 
At first everyone seemed really nice and I got some phone numbers‚Ä¶
But now, whenever I text or try to call I get ignored. 
I‚Äôm making sure not to be annoying, and stop trying to reach out once I get no reply. 

The people in this group do seem kind of cliquey, and a lot of them have kids and a family of their own. 
I don‚Äôt have kids, but am super understanding of people who have kids, and a life of their own, etc..

I asked one of the main women to be my sponsor, and I got kind of a weird reaction from her. The reason I wanted to ask her, is because she has been so nice to me since day one, and also raises her hand when asked to be a sponsor at each meeting. She has also been sober a few years. When I asked her about sponsorship, she got kind of weird about it. She then told me that she is already sponsoring someone else in our group and had to reach out to her sponsor to see if it would be okay. 

She called me a few days ago and let me know right off the bat that she has 5 kids, and is super busy. 
Then she said she‚Äôd go with me to a meeting today, but then cancelled right beforehand.
I totally understand, but feel kind of like a huge burden on everyone in my group. 
They all have busy lives, and I do too, but am the only woman in my group who doesn‚Äôt have kids. 

Other meetings are all men, who are my dads age. I just feel uncomfortable all around as a newcomer to AA.
I thought this woman‚Äôs group I have been going to seemed better, but everyone there has a lot of sobriety under their belt and appears to be too busy to help newcomers. 

There are no smart recovery meetings in this area that I moved to recently, and I just feel really alone. :(",17,0
